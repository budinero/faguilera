I'm a passionate Electronic Engineer with a Doctorate in Engineering Science. My current research revolves around  fault-tolerant control systems for electric vehicles and micro-grid energy management. In the classroom, I share my expertise in control, embedded systems, and signal processing for telecommunications. My contributions in education and research always have the commitment to bridging theory with practical application. 

In addition to my research and teaching roles, I actively collaborate with industry partners to implement real-world applications of advanced electronic systems.

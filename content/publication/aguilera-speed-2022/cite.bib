 abstract = {In this work, a sensor fault-tolerant architecture (FTA) for induction motor drives used in electric vehicles (EV) is presented. A bank of observers is designed based on representations of the induction motor model in different reference frames. The fault diagnosis is performed by processing a set of residuals obtained from the bank of observers. The diagnosis method is able to differentiate between single and multiple faults as well as identify the faulty sensor. In addition, virtual sensors are used for the control feedback reconfiguration to obtain a continuous operation of a vector control strategy after a sensor fault. Simulation results of an EV with the proposed FTA validate the effectiveness of the proposal and its robustness against parameter variations. Moreover, results shows a fast control reconfiguration and the ability to return to normal operation if the sensors recover from the faulty condition.},

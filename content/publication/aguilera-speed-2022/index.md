abstract: In this work, a sensor fault-tolerant architecture (FTA) for induction motor
  drives used in electric vehicles (EV) is presented. A bank of observers is designed
  based on representations of the induction motor model in different reference frames.
  The fault diagnosis is performed by processing a set of residuals obtained from
  the bank of observers. The diagnosis method is able to differentiate between single
  and multiple faults as well as identify the faulty sensor. In addition, virtual
  sensors are used for the control feedback reconfiguration to obtain a continuous
  operation of a vector control strategy after a sensor fault. Simulation results
  of an EV with the proposed FTA validate the effectiveness of the proposal and its
  robustness against parameter variations. Moreover, results shows a fast control
  reconfiguration and the ability to return to normal operation if the sensors recover
  from the faulty condition.

 abstract = {In this work, a current sensors fault tolerant control system (FTCS) for induction motor traction drives is proposed. The FTCS uses a single observer for the detection and isolation of disconnection and gain faults occurred in a single or two current sensors available in the drive. Moreover, the observer signals are used for the control reconfiguration within a field-oriented control strategy. The effectiveness of the FTCS (detection, isolation and reconfiguration) and the performance of the control strategy after different faults and perturbations is verified by simulation results using an electric vehicle model.},

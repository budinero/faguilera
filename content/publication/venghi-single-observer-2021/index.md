abstract: In this work, a current sensors fault tolerant control system (FTCS) for
  induction motor traction drives is proposed. The FTCS uses a single observer for
  the detection and isolation of disconnection and gain faults occurred in a single
  or two current sensors available in the drive. Moreover, the observer signals are
  used for the control reconfiguration within a field-oriented control strategy. The
  effectiveness of the FTCS (detection, isolation and reconfiguration) and the performance
  of the control strategy after different faults and perturbations is verified by
  simulation results using an electric vehicle model.

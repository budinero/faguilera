abstract: This project describes the investigation, development and implementation
  of an electronic device that measures the required force to break a seed. The device
  is based on a load cell which measures the force applied to the solid. The device
  detects the instant when the sample breaks. The obtained hardness values are stored
  in the device internal memory and are visualized in a liquid crystal display. Also,
  the device can be connected to a computer to show on a graphic the instantaneous
  force values applied to a seed or to download the hardness values. The device performance
  was verified through sample measurements with statistically known hardness values.

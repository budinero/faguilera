abstract: In this work, a fault tolerant control system for current sensors in induction
  motor drives is proposed. The system is composed by two standar control strategies
  and a bank of observers. The fault detection and isolation is performed by processing
  residuals generated by the bank of observers. When sensors are healthy, the motor
  is controlled by a vector control strategy using two current sensors. If a single
  current sensor fault occurs, the vector control is maintained by replacing the affected
  information with estimations generated by the bank of observers. If faults occur
  in both current sensors, a scalar control strategy is used in order to maintain
  the operation of the drive. The operation of the proposed system is validated by
  simulation results.

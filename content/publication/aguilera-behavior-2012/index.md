abstract: The behavior of an electric vehicle and its electric traction drive under
  sensor faults is studied in this paper. With this aim, simulations over a vehicle
  model with rear traction, using an induction machine, were carried out. The drive
  model can switch between three different conventional control strategies. With this
  setup, the longitudinal dynamics behavior of the vehicle and the electrical variables
  of the drive against sensor faults and changes of the control strategy are analyzed.
  The obtained results are useful in the design of a sensor fault tolerant architecture.

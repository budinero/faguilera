 abstract = {The behavior of an electric vehicle and its electric traction drive under sensor faults is studied in this paper. With this aim, simulations over a vehicle model with rear traction, using an induction machine, were carried out. The drive model can switch between three different conventional control strategies. With this setup, the longitudinal dynamics behavior of the vehicle and the electrical variables of the drive against sensor faults and changes of the control strategy are analyzed. The obtained results are useful in the design of a sensor fault tolerant architecture.},

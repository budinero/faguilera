abstract: This work presents the design of a current-sensor fault detection and isolation
  system for induction-motor drives. A differential geometric approach is addressed
  to determine if faults can be detected and isolated in drives with two line current
  sensors by using a model based strategy. A set of subsystems is obtained based on
  the observability co-distribution, whose outputs are decoupled from the load torque
  (detectability) and only affected by one of the sensors (isolability). A bank of
  observers is designed for these subsystems in order to obtain residuals for the
  fault detection and isolation. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategy allows
  detecting single and multiple sensor faults, including disconnection, offset and
  gain faults. Experimental results validate the proposal.

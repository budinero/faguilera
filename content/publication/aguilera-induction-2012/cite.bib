 abstract = {Different induction machine (IM) models are evaluated, with the aim to determine its usefulness in efficiency studies for electric vehicles (EV) traction drives. In particular, two simple IM models proposed in the literature, which take into account the additional losses, are compared. With this aim, model parameters are adjusted from experimental tests performed on a 4 kW IM. Then, obtained results from both models at different operating points are compared. Even when the estimation errors are similar using both models, one of them is chosen because of its simplicity. Finally, a simple application of this model is proposed, which consists in use the model for obtaining a complete efficiency map of the IM, without need further essays. Such efficiency map can be used to evaluate the overall efficiency of the traction drive of an EV or in EV design.},

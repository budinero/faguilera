abstract: Different induction machine (IM) models are evaluated, with the aim to determine
  its usefulness in efficiency studies for electric vehicles (EV) traction drives.
  In particular, two simple IM models proposed in the literature, which take into
  account the additional losses, are compared. With this aim, model parameters are
  adjusted from experimental tests performed on a 4 kW IM. Then, obtained results
  from both models at different operating points are compared. Even when the estimation
  errors are similar using both models, one of them is chosen because of its simplicity.
  Finally, a simple application of this model is proposed, which consists in use the
  model for obtaining a complete efficiency map of the IM, without need further essays.
  Such efficiency map can be used to evaluate the overall efficiency of the traction
  drive of an EV or in EV design.

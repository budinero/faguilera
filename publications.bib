  abstract = {In this article, a vector control strategy based on indirect rotor field-oriented control (IRFOC) for star-connected three-phase induction motor (SCTPIM) drives under open-phase fault (OPF) using balanced and unbalanced transformation matrices (TMs) is proposed. Most of the current works studying SCTPIM drives under this type of fault are based on using two unbalanced TMs and ignore the leakage inductance in the FOC equations. This article studies a novel control strategy, considering the leakage inductance in the FOC equations of an SCTPIM drive under OPF. It is shown that using an unbalanced TM for stator current components and the conventional balanced TM for stator voltage components, it is possible to control an SCTPIM under OPF using a modified IRFOC system. The proposed vector control scheme is simulated and implemented using MATLAB/M-File software and DSP/TMS320F28335 controller board for a 0.75 kW SCTPIM drive system. Results show that the introduced IRFOC technique can satisfactorily control the SCTPIM under OPF condition.},

This research proposes a post-fault operation strategy based on direct rotor field-oriented control (RFOC) technique for wye-connected TPIM drives during SOPF. In the proposed control system, symmetrical and asymmetrical transformation matrices are utilized for stator voltage and current variables, respectively. In addition, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used for the rotor flux estimation, filtration of stator currents, and obtaining their time derivatives. The performance of the introduced technique including steady and transient states during different reference speeds is experimentally validated for a wye-connected TPIM drive considering SOPF. Additionally, the performance of the proposed strategy is experimentally compared with conventional RFOC strategies.},

  abstract = {With the absence of renewable energy sources (RES) and energy storage systems (ESS), home energy management systems (HEMS) suffer more difficulties to schedule the household demand without affecting the homeowner's lifestyle or exceeding distribution transformer maximum loading. The problem is more complicated when considering other practical situations like multi-trips and urgent charging activities of electric vehicles (EV) during the peak periods. In this paper, a HEMS strategy is proposed to coordinate the operation of the household load demand, including charging/discharging activities of EVs batteries in homes that are not integrated with RES nor ESS. The proposed strategy is intended to reduce the daily energy cost, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and alleviate stresses on the distribution transformer while maintaining the homeowner's convenience. Unlike most previous studies, the proposed strategy considers EV multi-trips and battery degradation associated with home discharging activities. The proposed strategy coordinates the operation of various household appliances while the charging algorithm tackles the problem of urgent charging related to multi-trips requirements. Furthermore, by using battery degradation cost and energy tariff, the proposed strategy investigates the economic feasibility of home discharging activities of EVs. The strategy is applied to a residential neighborhood with three houses with various numbers of residents and various load profiles. The results proved the proposed strategy's effectiveness in reducing the energy cost and PAR while maintaining the transformer loading limit even if there are charging activities during peak or high tariff periods.},

Current sensor failure (outage), speed/position sensor loss (disconnection), and damaged DC-link voltage sensor are considered faults. The occurrence of these faults in PMSM drive systems degrades system performance and affects the safety, maintenance, and service continuity of the electrical system drives. The proposed method is based on the monitoring signals of ``abc'' currents, DC-link voltage, and rotor speed/position using a measurement chain. The listed signals are analyzed and evaluated with the generated residuals and threshold values obtained from a Sliding Mode Current-Speed-DC-link Voltage Observer (SMCSVO) to acquire an on-line fault decision. The novelty of the method is the faults diagnosis algorithm that combines the use of SMCSVO and adaptive thresholds; thus, the number of false alarms is reduced, and the reliability and robustness of the fault detection system are guaranteed. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm's performance is experimentally analyzed and tested in real time using a dSPACE DS 1104 digital signal processor board.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of sensor-fault-tolerant control for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The LPV systems under consideration are subject to modeling uncertainties and depend on a set of parameters that are assumed to be bounded and available online. Three schemes are proposed to achieve sensor-fault-tolerant control. First, a low-order LPV observer is proposed to simultaneously estimate the unmeasured states and the sensor faults. Second, the estimated sensor faults are used to design a fault decision scheme to detect the sensor faults and to prevent false alarms caused by modeling uncertainties and/or measurement noise. Third, a fault-tolerant control scheme is designed by using the estimated states and the estimated sensor faults to compensate for the effects of sensor faults. To show the effectiveness of the proposed results, the developed schemes are applied to three practical examples consisting of a continuous stirred tank reactor, a single-link robotic arm, and a liquid level process. The simulation results for the first two examples and the experimental results for the liquid level process example indicate that the proposed schemes work well.},

In particular, state-of-the-art applications rely on the quick and efficient treatment of malfunctions within the equipment/system, resulting in increased production and reduced downtimes. This paper presents developments within Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods and reviews of research work in this area. The review presents both traditional model-based and relatively new signal processing-based FDD approaches, with a special consideration paid to artificial intelligence-based FDD methods. Typical steps involved in the design and development of automatic FDD system, including system knowledge representation, data-acquisition and signal processing, fault classification, and maintenance related decision actions, are systematically presented to outline the present status of FDD. Future research trends, challenges and prospective solutions are also highlighted.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a study of adaptive phase recovery in quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) based communication systems. Here, we modify the traditional fourth-power phase recovery algorithm (FP-PRA) to propose three improved algorithms, and analyze their performances in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, phase noise, frequency-offset, and inter-symbol interference. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain the optimal values of step-sizes (or loop-gains) in closed-form in the presence of phase noise and/or frequency-offset. In particular, we discuss two methods to improve FP-PRA. The first method involves utilizing the idea of partitioning the QAM constellation into QPSK-like and not-QPSK-like annular regions. The phase synchronizer is allowed to update only when a derotated QAM symbol lies in QPSK-like region; otherwise, the update process is stopped. The second method exploits an evolving idea of QAM-to-QPSK transformation, and uses transformed symbols to estimate phase mismatch. We provide a new interpretation of this transformation method and relate it to the quadrant-wise centroid of the rotated constellation. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of this method for both square and cross-QAM, and, identify and verify numerically the existence of false-locks in the case of cross-QAM. To the best of our knowledge, the ideas of constellation partitioning and constellation transformation have not appeared earlier in the context of adaptive phase recovery. We discuss adaptive blind estimation of optimal step-sizes in the presence of phase noise and frequency-offset. Finally, we discuss the modification of the proposed stochastic gradient methods to transform them into batch processing algorithms so as to make them more suitable for higher data rate systems. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms can outperform the traditional FP-PRA algorithm for a number of practical QAM sizes under different mismatch conditions, and that our analytical findings are in close agreement with the simulation results.},

This article concerns the analysis of the direct field-oriented control induction motor drive after the failure of all stator current sensors. An adaptive virtual current sensor (AVCS) was used to estimate the stator current, based on the measurement of the motor angular velocity and the voltage in the \${\textbackslash}textDC{\textbackslash} (u\_{\textbackslash}textDC)\$ of the voltage-source inverter. This article presents the possibility of improving the accuracy of stator current estimation using the original approximation of changes in rotor resistance depending on the drive operating point when the measurement information about the stator current has been lost. This approximation was determined experimentally during the normal operation of the drive using a rotor resistance estimator. The determined approximate lookup functions were used to adapt the rotor resistance in the AVCS during the drive system operation in a postfault mode. This approach has made it possible to significantly improve the accuracy of the stator current reconstruction, especially under low speeds and load torques, which was demonstrated in experimental studies.},

Such systems provide a higher degree of security and solutions that allow the on-line detection and localization of failures, as well as the switching of the control mode to a mode that allows us to continue the operation or safely stop the drive system. As the current sensors (CSs) are necessary to ensure precise control of the AC motors, in the event of their failure, one of two strategies can be used{\textemdash}hardware or software redundancy. The first strategy requires the use of additional measuring sensors. For this reason, the algorithmic solution, based on the Luenberger Observer (LO), has been proposed in this article as one of the software redundancy methods. In contrast to methods presented in the literature, the proposed solution allows one not only to compensate the stator current in a phase with a faulty CS, but also to adjust the correction of current estimation based on a measured signal in the other phase with a healthy CS. Extensive simulation studies in the direct rotor flux-oriented control (DRFOC) structure with the induction motor (IM) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed solution allows the drive system to be controlled even if all CSs are damaged.},

  abstract = {Designing electrical drives resistant to the failures of chosen sensors has recently become increasingly popular due to the possibility of their use in fault-tolerant control (FTC) systems including drives for electric vehicles. In this article, a virtual current sensor (VCS) based on an algorithmic method for the reconstruction of the induction motor (IM) phase currents after current sensor faults was proposed. This stator current estimator is based only on the measurements of the DC-bus voltage in the intermediate circuit of the voltage-source inverter (VSI) and a rotor speed. This proposal is dedicated to fault-tolerant vector controlled IM drives, where it is necessary to switch to scalar control as a result of damage to the current sensors. The proposed VCS allows further uninterrupted operation of the direct rotor-field oriented control (DRFOC) of the induction motor drive. The stator current estimator has been presented in the form of equations, enabling its practical implementation in a microprocessor system. Simulation studies of the proposed algorithm in an open and closed-loop DRFOC structure are presented under different operation conditions of the drive system. The experimental verification of the proposed method is also presented and the accuracy of the stator current estimation algorithm is analyzed under various operating conditions of the drive system.},

  abstract = {Due to random patterns of demand response from the consumer side and the unreliable nature of renewable energy resources, load flow balancing and transient stability become challenging issues in power systems. They are even more challenging in cases of multiple interval three phase (L-L-L) faults (MITPFs), which arise in power systems due to power quality disturbances. The intent of this work is to examine the influence of MITPFs on renewable energy resources (RERs) for load flow balancing and transient stability analysis. Wind turbine power dispatchability and uncertainty have a significant impact on load flow balancing and transient stability, especially in cases of occurrence of MITPFs. Probabilistic modeling is performed in this paper to formulate the complexity of randomness for load flow balancing through a smart node and transient stability analysis through a unified power flow controller. The proposed probabilistic algorithm is based on the deviations between generation and demand response patterns due to an MITPF. An autocorrelation expansion is applied to approximate the randomness of probabilistic variables between the forecast generation and actual response pattern. Future contingencies can be predicted before disruptive changes arise due to the occurrence of an MITPF using the above probabilistic analysis. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing alternatives and can achieve near optimal performance for a wide range of load variations and power quality disturbances in renewable-integrated power grids.},

The proposed algorithm is responsible for the potential heterogeneous faults in units' actuators, like loss of effectiveness (LOE) and unknown bias faults. Furthermore, the communication network is considered as a directed switching graph, which can be viewed as an unreliable network and makes the CFTC problem more challenging. Also, in addition to the distributed generation (DG) units, we consider the presence of distributed energy storage (DES) systems that operate in the islanded microgrid. In addition to the voltage and frequency regulation, it is required to balance the state of charge (SoC) of DESs to achieve accurate active power-sharing. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed CFTC algorithm, simulation studies are carried out on a test microgrid system in MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results are compared with several previously-reported methods. Simulation results and comparison with other previously-reported techniques reveal the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in regulating microgrid voltage and frequency, balancing of SoC, and providing accurate proportional active power-sharing.},

In the first algorithm, a distributed adaptive fault-tolerant method is employed to compensate for the potential sensor faults. Then, to address both sensor and actuator faults simultaneously, a distributed \$H\_{\i}nfty \$ protocol is employed to guarantee the voltage and frequency synchronization for the closed-loop system. In the design of these algorithms, there is no need to know the amplitude or any quantitative information about fault signals. Additionally, there is no restriction on the number of faulty units.

  abstract = {Distributed assets, such as hybrid power system components, require reliable, timely, and secure coordinated data monitoring and control systems. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a technology for the coordinated monitoring and control of such assets. However, SCADA system designs and implementations have largely been proprietary, mostly pricey and therefore economically unjustifiable for smaller applications. With proprietary SCADA systems, there is also the problem of interoperability with the existing components such as power electronic converters, energy storage systems, and communication systems since these components are usually from multiple vendors. Therefore, an open source SCADA system represents the most flexible and most cost-effective SCADA option for such assets. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-cost, open source SCADA system based on the most recent SCADA architecture, the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed SCADA system consists of current and voltage sensors for data collection, an ESP32 micro-controller with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, for receiving and processing the sensor data, and ThingsBoard IoT server for historic data storage and human machine interactions. For the sensor data transfer from the ESP32 to the ThingsBoard IoT server, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is implemented for data transfer over a local Wi-Fi connection with the MQTT Client configured on the ESP32, and the ThingsBoard server node serving as the MQTT Broker. The ThingsBoard IoT server is locally installed with PostgreSQL database on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and hosted locally on MUN Network for data integrity and security. To test the performance of the developed open source SCADA system solution, it was setup to acquire and process the current, voltage and power of a standalone solar photovoltaic system for remote monitoring and supervisory control. The overall system design procedures and testing, as well as the created dashboards and alarms on the ThingsBoard IoT server platform are presented in the paper.},

The scheme of the proposed controller consists of the design of a nonlinear controller for the duty cycle generation. For this purpose, a simple and low- cost voltage-oriented controller is proposed in this study. In fact, this control algorithm is suitable to efficiently track fast irradiance changes. Consequently, the efficiency of the overall MPPT system is improved by avoiding loss of PV power caused by i) oscillatory responses due to varying irradiance conditions and ii) load disturbances. In addition, by assuming passivity properties of the constitutive relationship of the load element, internal stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed for different load conditions, which are applicable for most PV applications. Besides, the internal stability allows to consider load scenarios affected by bounded disturbances. Finally, the proposed MPPT control system is implemented by using a proportional-integral-derivative controller, thereby providing a low-cost solution, which is programmed in the TMS320F28379D DSC Board. Experimental results by considering several scenarios, i.e., i) irradiance changes, ii) changes of setpoint and iii) load disturbances are illustrated to validate the effectiveness of the proposal.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture incorporating a central energy storage system (ESS) for both the AC and the DC sub-grids. To ensure effective operation of the proposed hybrid AC/DC microgrid architecture, a coordinated control strategy between the central ESS and the inter-linking converter (ILC) is proposed in the paper. The proposed central ESS provides voltage and frequency control to the AC sub-grid by measuring voltage and frequency at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the AC sub-grid, while providing DC voltage support to the DC sub-grid by measuring DC sub-grid's PCC voltage. Furthermore, per-unit frequency and the DC sub-grid PCC voltage are utilized to transfer power between the two sub-grids via the ILC. Therefore, two control strategies are coordinating with each other and maintain stable operation. The central ESS eliminates the use of multiple ILCs and complex control schemes for charge and discharge control to maintain same state of charge levels at each ESS. Effectiveness of the proposed coordinated controller is verified by applying various load disturbances, faults, and under different modes of operation.},

  abstract = {Self-governing small regions of power systems, known as ``microgrids'', are enabling the integration of small-scale renewable energy sources (RESs) while improving the reliability and energy efficiency of the electricity network. Microgrids can be primarily classified into three types based on their voltage characteristics and system architecture; 1) AC microgrids, 2) DC microgrids, and 3) Hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper presents a comprehensive review of stability, control, power management and fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for the AC, DC, and hybrid AC/DC microgrids. This paper also classifies microgrids in terms of their intended application and summarises the operation requirements stipulated in standards (e.g., IEEE Std. 1547-2018). The control strategies for each microgrid architecture are reviewed in terms of their operating principle and performance. In terms of the hybrid AC/DC microgrids, specific control aspects, such as mode transition and coordinated control between multiple interlinking converters (ILCs) and energy storage system (ESS) are analysed. A case study is also presented on the dynamic performance of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid under different control strategies and dynamic loads. Hybrid AC/DC microgrids shown to have more advantages in terms of economy and efficiency compared with the other microgrid architectures. This review shows that hierarchical control schemes, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary control are very popular among all three microgrid types. It is shown that the hybrid AC/DC microgrids require more complex control strategies for power management and control compared to AC or DC microgrids due to their dependency on the ILC controls and the operation mode of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. Case study illustrated the significant effects of microgrid feeder characteristics on the dynamic performance of the hybrid AC/DC microgrid. It is also revealed that any transient conditions either in the AC or DC microgrids could propagate through the ILC affecting the entire microgrid dynamic performance. Additionally, the critical control issues and the future research challenges of microgrids are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {This letter focuses on the problem of leader-following consensus of second-order Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with switching topology and partial aperiodic sampled data. MAS are subject to various constraints related to information exchange among the agents. It is considered that each agent in the network is able to measure its position only and cannot measure either its velocity or acceleration (input). Moreover, the position information is sent to the neighbors at aperiodic and asynchronous sampling rates. At last, a switching communication topology among the agents is considered. An observer-based control protocol is proposed to achieve leader-following consensus for MAS with above mentioned constraints. Using an Average Dwell Time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions are derived through Lyapunov-based stability analysis to ensure the leader-following consensus. Numerical examples are also included to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Firstly, the case of multi-motor systems in automotive applications is laid out by presenting the different vehicular systems comprising multiple motors. Secondly, multi-motor drive topologies with improved power density, reliability and fault tolerance capabilities are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, the topologies are assessed and compared in the context of automotive applications. The assessment verifies that multi-motor drives allow for fault tolerant and cost-effective solutions that are suitable for automotive applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, due to the wide utilization of direct current (DC) power sources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells, different DC loads, high-level integration of different energy storage systems such as batteries, supercapacitors, DC microgrids have been gaining more importance. Furthermore, unlike conventional AC systems, DC microgrids do not have issues such as synchronization, harmonics, reactive power control, and frequency control. However, the incorporation of different distributed generators, such as PV, wind, fuel cell, loads, and energy storage devices in the common DC bus complicates the control of DC bus voltage as well as the power-sharing. In order to ensure the secure and safe operation of DC microgrids, different control techniques, such as centralized, decentralized, distributed, multilevel, and hierarchical control, are presented. The optimal planning of DC microgrids has an impact on operation and control algorithms; thus, coordination among them is required. A detailed review of the planning, operation, and control of DC microgrids is missing in the existing literature. Thus, this article documents developments in the planning, operation, and control of DC microgrids covered in research in the past 15 years. DC microgrid planning, operation, and control challenges and opportunities are discussed. Different planning, control, and operation methods are well documented with their advantages and disadvantages to provide an excellent foundation for industry personnel and researchers. Power-sharing and energy management operation, control, and planning issues are summarized for both grid-connected and islanded DC microgrids. Also, key research areas in DC microgrid planning, operation, and control are identified to adopt cutting-edge technologies. This review explicitly helps readers understand existing developments on DC microgrid planning, operation, and control as well as identify the need for additional research in order to further contribute to the topic.},

  abstract = {State estimation is one of the main challenges in the microgrids, due to the complexity of the system dynamics and the limitations of the communication network. In this regard, a novel real-time event-based optimal state estimator is introduced in this article, which uses the proposed adaptive send-on-delta (SoD) nonuniform sampling method over wireless sensors networks. The proposed estimator requires low communication bandwidth and incurs lower computational resource cost. The threshold for the SoD sampler is made adaptive based on the average communication link delay, which is computed in a distributed form using the event-based average consensus protocol. The SoD nonuniform signal sampling approach reduces the traffic over the wireless communication network due to the events transmitted only when there is a level crossing in the measurements. The state estimator structure is extended on top of the traditional Kalman filter with the additional stages for the fusion of the received events. The error correction stage is further improved by optimal reconstruction of the signals using projection onto convex sets algorithm. Finally, an Internet of things (IoT) experimental platform based on LoRaWAN and IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) protocols are developed to analyze the performance of the state estimator for the IEEE 5 Bus case study microgrid.},

To this end, we motivate the adoption of input-to-state stability (ISS) to deal with the estimation error involved by state observers in performing state estimation for nonlinear continuous-time systems. Such stability properties are ensured by means of ISS Lyapunov functions that satisfy Hamilton\&ndash;Jacobi inequalities. Based on this general framework, we focus on observers for polynomial nonlinear systems and the sum-of-squares paradigm to find such Lyapunov functions.},

The proposed controller is applied to compensate for the errors in the system frequency and voltage profiles in the presence of MG faults. The proposed controller also enables the system to ensure an accurate sharing of the active and reactive power among the connected distributed generations (DGs) in MG. The consensus-based controller depends on the information transferring between MG neighbor agents through a graph communication network. The proposed secondary controller improves the primary controllers' performance, including droop control and inner voltage and current controllers. The proposed controller has been verified using a hypothetical multi-agent MG system in MATLAB/Simulink environment. A comparative analysis between the results obtained from applying the proposed controller and the primary droop control method (DCM). The proposed controller's performance is evaluated using the controller response time, the maximum frequency deviation, and the steady-state restoration time. The results show the proposed secondary FTC method's effectiveness in mitigating the faults' effect in multi-agent MG.},

  abstract = {Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) are considered as a potential candidate in many high-reliability demanding applications, including electrical vehicles (EVs), hybrid EVs and more electric aircrafts. For precise and stable control performance, normally an SRM drive requires one current sensor for each phase winding. Failure of any of these sensors will inevitably degrade the system's performance. The behaviour of an SRM drive under current sensor failure is investigated and a fault-tolerant control technique is proposed by changing the current sensor installation scheme without adding extra current sensors. Moreover, through the analysis of the detected currents by the phase current sensors and the dc-link sensor, a diagnostic scheme for current sensors failure is presented. The excitation current in the faulty phase under postfault conditions is reconstructed through a simple calculation without injecting a high-frequency signal or modifying the switching signals, thereby reducing the current distortion and avoiding voltage penalty issues. Motor drive can operate with satisfactory control performance even when all the phase current sensors are in fault conditions. Detailed analysis under both steady state and dynamic conditions through thorough simulations and experiments has been carried out on a three-phase 12/8 SRM. The extensive results validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.},

Orientation angles are obtained using a nonlinear Luenberger observer, while the common offset issues on the magnetometer are calibrated by a recursive least-square algorithm. The strategy is implemented using a TM4C123GXL microcontroller and a MPU9150 sensor (nine-axis: gyro, accelerometer and magnetometer), which makes it a low-cost, compact system.

Instead of using sixth-order extended Kalman filters (EKFs), rotor flux is estimated by means of a fourth-order descriptor-type robust KF, which explicitly takes into account motor parameter uncertainties, whereas the speed is estimated using a recursive least squares algorithm starting from the knowledge of the rotor flux itself. It is shown that the descriptor-type structure allows for a direct translation of parameter uncertainties into variations of the coefficients appearing in the model, and this improves the degree of robustness of the estimates. Experimental findings, carried out on a closed-loop system consisting of a low-power induction-motor-load system, a proportional-integral-type controller, and the proposed estimator, are shown with the aim of verifying the goodness of the whole closed-loop control system.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review categorically on the recent advances and previous research developments of the smart grid paradigm over the last two decades. The main intent of the study is to provide an application-focused survey where every category and sub-category herein are thoroughly and independently investigated. The preamble of the paper highlights the concept and the structure of the smart grids. The work presented intensively and extensively reviews the recent advances on the energy data management in smart grids, pricing modalities in a modernized power grid, and the predominant components of the smart grid. The paper thoroughly enumerates the recent advances in the area of network reliability. On the other hand, the reliance on smart cities on advanced communication infrastructure promotes more concerns regarding data integrity. Therefore, the paper dedicates a sub-section to highlight the challenges and the state-of-the-art of cybersecurity. Furthermore, highlighting the emerging developments in the pricing mechanisms concludes the review.},

Electric Vehicles (EVs) and industrial machinery will continue to significantly increase in the coming years with the advent of Smart Grid (SG) with EVs integration system. The changeable increase of EVs makes them a valuable device in the modern era. SG is principally defined as the use of information technology with the electric by transferring electricity in both directions. This means to import and export to the grid via EVs, i.e Vehicle to Grid (V2G) operation. Recent literature demonstrated the significance of EVs to overcome power and environmental issues using energy management strategy (EMS). This article reviews the achievement of EMSs in the EV system reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. To close the gap between the existing bodies of knowledge, this article focuses on the up-to-date and state-of-the-art standards of EV technology, energy resources, charging topologies and infrastructure, EMS classification, power conditional units, and electric load management. Recommendations are given as future research work to address the challenges affecting the V2G technology.

A robust sliding mode sensor fault reconstruction scheme based on an LPV model is presented, where the fault reconstruction signal is obtained from the so-called equivalent output error injection signal associated with the observer. The development process includes implementing the design using AIRBUS׳s the so-called SAO library which allows the automatic generation of flight certifiable code which can be implemented on the actual flight control computer. The proposed scheme has been subjected to various tests and evaluations on the Functional Engineering Simulator conducted by the industrial partners associated with the ADDSAFE project. These were designed to cover a wide range of the flight envelope, specific challenging manoeuvres and realistic fault types. The detection and isolation logic together with a statistical assessment of the FDD schemes are also presented. Simulation results from various levels of FDD developments (from tuning, testing and industrial evaluation) show consistently good results and fast detection times.},

For actuator faults, a controller is designed around a state-feedback sliding-mode scheme where the gain of the nonlinear unit vector term is allowed to adaptively increase at the onset of a fault. Unexpected deviation of the switching variables from their nominal condition triggers the adaptation mechanism. The controller proposed here is relatively simple and yet is shown to work across the entire "up and away" flight envelope. For sensor faults, the application of a robust method for fault reconstruction using a sliding-mode observer is considered. The novelty lies in the application of the sensor fault reconstruction scheme to correct the corrupted measured signals before they are used by the controller, and therefore the controller does not need to be reconfigured.},

In this context, classical linear controllers remain widely employed due to their simplicity and success in industrial applications. However, the models and methods commonly used for control design lack valuable information, which is fundamental to guarantee robustness and high performance. Following this line, the design and existence of linear fixed controllers is examined using individual channel analysis and design. The studies presented here aim to establish guidelines for the design of simple (time invariant, low order, stable, minimum phase, and decentralized) yet robust and high-performance linear controllers. Such characteristics ease the implementation task and are well suited for engineering applications, making the resulting controllers a good alternative for the stator current control required for high-performance IM schemes such as field-oriented, passivity-based, and intelligent control. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the analysis and controller design of an IM, with results validated in a real-time experimental platform. It is shown that it is possible to completely decouple the stator current subsystem without the use of additional decoupling elements.},

Several important characteristics of IFOC are elucidated, leading to the design of linear, robust, and performance-based torque, speed, and position controllers. In particular, the resulting controllers are of a low order, robust to rotor resistance perturbations, and are designed according to classical performance specifications, which is a combination of characteristics that have been historically difficult to achieve. General control design guidelines valid for any induction motor are presented. In addition, the stability and minimum phase conditions of the IFOC torque controller are fully derived for any induction motor. These conditions are of prime importance when designing fixed linear speed or position controllers. A case study for a typical motor, including the design of a series of robust controllers and real-time experimental results, is presented. The proposed approach makes use of well-known classical control methods that allow the results presented here to be further extended using any linear single-input-single-output controller design tool, such as H{$\infty$} and quantitative feedback theory.},

However, the high number of virtual vectors increases computational burden significantly. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a novel algorithm that reduces the number of admissible voltage vectors, based on the well-known direct torque control switching table, is presented. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that proposed PTC-DSVM has the same behavior as conventional PTC at the same switching frequency while the sampling frequency is three times lower. The low sampling frequency of the proposed algorithm makes it suitable for industries to use low-cost hardware or perform a high computational analysis.},

  abstract = {Batteries, ultracapacitors (UCs), and fuel cells are widely being proposed for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) as an electric power source or an energy storage unit. In general, the design of an intelligent control strategy for coordinated power distribution is a critical issue for UC-supported PHEV power systems. Implementation of several control methods has been presented in the past, with the goal of improving battery life and overall vehicle efficiency. It is clear that the control objectives vary with respect to vehicle velocity, power demand, and state of charge of both the batteries and UCs. Hence, an optimal control strategy design is the most critical aspect of an all-electric/plug-in hybrid electric vehicle operational characteristic. Although much effort has been made to improve the life of PHEV energy storage systems (ESSs), including research on energy storage device chemistries, this paper, on the contrary, highlights the fact that the fundamental problem lies within the design of power-electronics-based energy-management converters and the development of smarter control algorithms. This paper initially discusses battery and UC characteristics and then goes on to provide a detailed comparison of various proposed control strategies and proposes the use of precise power electronic converter topologies. Finally, this paper summarizes the benefits of the various techniques and suggests the most viable solutions for on-board power management, more specific to PHEVs with multiple/hybrid ESSs.},

However, both of them have a number of limits, such as the dependence on machine parameters of the vector control and the high ripples of DTC. This work presents a hybrid control strategy for induction motor (IM) based on the combining of the two techniques in order to benefit from their advantages and achieve high performance control. Besides, a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) observer will be used for speed estimation to improve the reliability and decrease the cost of the control system. Furthermore, the IM energy optimization will be treated as the second objective of this paper. A proposed model based strategy will be used for loss minimization. This strategy bases on online adjusting of the rotor flux magnitude reference and choosing an optimal value for each applied load torque. The proposed algorithm will be investigated by simulation and experimental implementation by using Matlab/Simulink with real time interface (RTI) based on dSpace 1104 board.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the estimation of the sensor faults and the state variables, using an unknown inputs observer (UIO), applied to an induction machine. A model based on LPV (linear parameter varying) systems of the machine is used where the rotation speed is considered as a variable parameter. Then based on Lyapunov theory, a feasible algorithm is explored to ensure the stability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the observer efficiency is investigated in presence of the current sensor faults. It is done by using the calculation of the observer gains based on the LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities). The contribution of this study lies on the development of an extended unknown inputs observer (UIO) to estimate the sensors faults. In addition, an augmented system is constructed, using a first filter, to transform the sensor faults to actuator faults and the noise to disturbance. The performance of this method is compared either in terms of state observation errors or in terms of fault estimation. The results obtained by simulation illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {With the need for more environmentally friendly transportation and the wide deployment of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have become a major issue for car manufacturers and a real challenge for researchers all over the world. Indeed, the high cost of battery energy storage, the limited EV autonomy and battery lifespan, the battery charging time, the deployment cost of a fast charging infrastructure, and the significant impact on the power grid are the origin of several research projects focused on advanced power electronics topologies and the optimization of the EV charging stations in terms of power transfer and geographical location. Three charging levels can be distinguished, which differ in terms of output power and charging time. The higher the level of charging, the faster the charging process, as more power is delivered to the vehicle at the expense of power quality issues and disturbances. Moreover, three types of charging systems can be distinguished, which are inductive recharging (contactless power transfer), conductive charging systems, and battery swapping. Additionally, EVs encompass fuel cell (FC) EVs, which uses hydrogen as primary energy resources, which is nowadays under extensive research activities in academia and industry. This review paper aims at presenting a state of the art review of major advances in power electronics architectures for EVs traction drives, and battery-based EVs charging stations. Specifically, the focus is made on light-duty electric vehicles drivetrain power electronics and charging stations specifications, the proposed power electronics solutions, the advantages and drawbacks of all these technologies, and perspectives for future research works in terms of smart EV charging and up-to-date solutions for power system disturbances mitigation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an open-circuit (OC) fault diagnostic method of inverters in closed-loop controlled permanent magnet synchronous motor drive systems based on current residual vector (CRV). This method can get rid of effects of the load and the main controller to obtain reliable detection. The motor drive system is a hybrid system composed of discrete switching signal events and continuous current state variables, which evolves in certain law driven by discrete events. At the base of analyzing operation modes of the system, a mixed logical dynamic (MLD) model of the motor drive system is built to estimate motor currents. Consequently, the proposed fault diagnostic scheme is constructed by the healthy current estimator based on the MLD model in parallel with the plant. When an OC fault occurs, the CRV between the estimator and the plant will show featured amplitude and phase, and hence the fault can be detected. The method utilizes variables already used by the main controller, avoiding the use of extra sensors. During the implementation, amplitude threshold and phase sector are used in order to avoid effects of measurement errors, model parameter errors and noises, which improves the reliability and robustness. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed diagnostic method, and the diagnostic duration can be reduced within a quarter of fundamental wave period.},

They are known as ultracapacitors or electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), which are energy storage devices providing high energy and efficiency. Their good characteristics make them suitable for usage in energy storage systems and the possibility to be charged/discharged rapidly without loss of efficiency for a lot of cycles. The supercapacitor pack can be successfully used in HESS (battery-supercapacitor system) combining different energy storage technologies with special control strategy using all the advantages of each energy source for improving and reaching overall performance.

In order to increase accuracy and reduce transients and oscillations the measured voltage drop is processed using a delta-sigma modulator. The data stream generated by the modulator is then transferred to a microcontroller supported demodulation for further processing and filtering. The paper also presents the results of experimental investigations of three different shunt inductors. The results demonstrate a high accuracy and noise immunity of the proposed method.},

However, so far, direct redundancy based approach for FTC of BLDC motor for a position sensor fault is not presented. This paper contributes a direct redundancy based method by utilizing redundant Hall-effect sensors for FTC of a BLDC motor. Redundant Hall-effect sensors generate additional transitions resulting in faster fault detection. To verify the proposed idea, MATLAB/Simulink model is developed, and the simulation results are presented by programing a MATLAB function block acting as a fault-tolerant controller. Furthermore, the algorithm is implemented into the MicroLabBox for experimental validation, and the results are discussed.},

  abstract = {The use of inverters in induction motor control has reduced classical motor faults, such as broken rotor bars or windings short-circuit, besides improving control performance. The control becomes faster and more precise, reducing peaks in current and torque, so that the motor can have a softer operation. On the other hand, new elements are included in the system and it will be necessary to take into account their faults. These elements are sensors and power electronic devices that since a control point of view are the system sensors and actuators. Fault tolerance tries to maintain the system under control in case a fault appears in the system. If this is not possible, it takes the system to a safe operational point. In this paper a fault-tolerant control for induction motors is designed. Based on a direct torque control, new control strategies have been added in case current sensor and power switch faults are detected. The challenge is to overcome these faults without any physical redundancy of sensors or power switches as other authors propose. With the proposed control, it will be possible to guarantee the motor operation in the whole speed{\textendash}torque range with one or none current sensors instead of the two usually used, though the performance will be slightly worsened. In case of inverter faults, the operation range will be restricted but the performance with respect to the fault situation is improved.},

There is now an increasing demand to transmit digital video signals and other digital information in an indoor environment. A solution to avoid the prohibitive cost of installing dedicated wires for this application is to transmit data over the power line. As the medium voltage and low voltage power lines transmit such high frequency communication signals, these signals undergo attenuation due to line loss and impedance mismatch because of branches and loads. Thus a signal which is received at the receiver end is not a replica of transmitter end signal, signifying of symbol error. In order to understand more about OFDM technique of transmission of data, in this paper we have carried out the performance analysis of transmission of digital data over indoor power lines using OFDM. The simulation results of the performance analysis show that 16-QAM symbol constellation is fully recovered and symbol error can be reduced significantly by suppressing some weak carriers.},

  abstract = {This article presents a transformer saturation prevention algorithm (SPA) targeting dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc-dc converters utilized in bidirectional, two-stage electric vehicle (EV) on-board battery chargers. Saturation prevention is achieved by detecting the variation in transformer current slope near the boundary of saturation and applying duty-cycle offsets to the DAB converter full bridges. Compared to alternative methods of saturation mitigation, the proposed algorithm offers the following benefits: Lower transformer design safety margins which enable volume reduction with minimal harm to efficiency, and low-cost implementation using a single low-cost current sensor even at high converter switching speeds. Experiments on a custom 6.6-kW on-board EV charger confirm the controller functionality and initial converter analysis. A peak converter efficiency of 96.8\% with a transformer volume of 80 cm3 is achieved, which is a 50\% volume reduction in comparison to other academic works.},

Moreover, they can have a vital role in Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems (AVCSSs) such as collision warning, adaptive cruise control, lane guidance driver assistance, brake assist as well as in modeling simulation of safety studies and capacity analysis in transportation science. In reality, sensor measurements are generally inaccurate. Surprisingly no comparative assessment of the car-following models in presence of sensor (measurement) errors for AVs exist till now to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate the prominent car-following models for Avs in presence of sensor errors in terms of safety, trip times, flow and fuel efficiency through simulations. We show that sensor errors significantly impact safety and flow in all models, while they do increase trip times and fuel consumption of some of the models. None of the models is completely fault-tolerant and suitable for AVs as some models produce collisions and/or negative velocity while all models violate traffic light. Nonetheless, the k-leader Fuel-efficient Traffic Model (kFTM) is the most fault-tolerant negative velocity and collision free model having reasonable trip times and energy consumption among the investigated models.},

Therefore, simultaneous reconfiguration of the drive control strategy is mandatory to enable an uninterrupted operation to cater for the catastrophic failure. In this context, this paper presents a current sensors fault-tolerant control method for induction motor drives, based on vector control and currents estimation. Several important issues are considered in the proposed method, namely, the detection of sensors failure, isolation of the faulty sensors, and reconfiguration of the control system by proper currents estimation. A new adaptation of the Luenberger observer is proposed and used to perform the task of stator currents estimation. Furthermore, a developed logic circuit is used to detect the faulty current sensors and isolate them with simultaneous generation of logic impulses allowing switching to a proper estimation. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is firstly tested in MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to illustrate its high-performance. Then, several experimental tests are carried out on a 1.1~kW three-phase induction motor to validate the theoretical results and to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {The ever increasing trend of renewable energy sources (RES) into the power system has increased the uncertainty in the operation and control of power system. The vulnerability of RES towards the unforeseeable variation of meteorological conditions demands additional resources to support. In such instance, energy storage systems (ESS) are inevitable as they are one among the various resources to support RES penetration. However, ESS has limited ability to fulfil all the requirements of a certain application. So, hybridization of multiple ESS to form a composite ESS is a potential solution. While integrating these different ESS, their power sharing control plays a crucial role to exploit the complementary characteristics of each other. Therefore, this article attempts to bring the numerous control strategies proposed in the literature at one place. Various control techniques implemented for HESS are critically reviewed and the notable observations are tabulated for better insights. Furthermore, the control techniques are classified into broad categories and they are briefly discussed with their limitations. From the carried-out analysis, the challenges faced towards the implementation of HESS for standalone and grid connected microgrid systems are presented. Finally, the future directions are laid out for the researchers to carry out the research and implementation of HESS technologies. Overall, this article would serve as a thorough guide on various control techniques implemented for HESS including their features, limitations and real-time applications.},

First, the switch open-circuit faults are detected by monitoring dwell times of the vector of the actual phase currents expressed in the stationary reference frame in each sector, where the normalisation of the current to its reference value is utilised, by which the immunity to the false alarms in transient conditions is improved significantly. Then, the IGBT open-circuit faults are identified, where leg open-circuit conditions are in the first place determined based on the average values of the normalised line-to-line currents. Next, the single open-circuit IGBT is located from the polarity of the corresponding phase current. By the proposed diagnosis method, the fault detection time is at the longest about 52.3 and 54\% of a fundamental period in the simulation and experimental tests, respectively, and the 27 possible cases of IGBT open-circuit faults combined for all IGBTs in the inverter can be identified. In addition, this algorithm can be implemented without any additional hardware and computational burden.},

  abstract = {Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is becoming of utmost importance in an automotive environment. With the increased number of magnetic field sources near the ADC that can alter its behaviors significantly, we need to model how magnetic field affects the performance of the ADC. Therefore, in order to accurately evaluate the practical performance of the ADC and the considerable off-chip and on-chip effects that are highly complex, the chip-printed circuit board (PCB) comodeling, cosimulation, and coanalysis are required. In this study, a comodel of the magnetic field effects on an ADC is proposed. The proposed comodel includes three separate submodels: a model of the magnetic field coupling from the wireless power transfer (WPT) system input to the PCB integrated with ADC, a model of the noise coupling from the PCB to the ADC input, and a model of the ADC behavior from the ADC input to the ADC outputs. Considering the magnetic field coupling from the magnetic field source to the PCB, a new inductive transmission line model (I-TLM) method is developed. This method achieves fast, precise, and broadband estimation of the magnetic field effects in comparison to previous estimation methods. To validate the proposed comodel, an ADC is fabricated using a 0.13-{$\mu$}m complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process and is wire-bonded to the designed PCB for ADC. A PCB-level WPT system is designed and built as the magnetic field source. The performance factor of the ADC is measured by sweeping the WPT system input frequency from 100 kHz to 1 GHz to find out the critical WPT system frequency for the designed ADC with the chip-PCB hierarchical structure. The results estimated by the proposed model correlate well with the full 3-D electromagnetic field simulation and measurement. The proposed modeling procedure reduces the time and computation resource in the design of the chip, package, and PCB to achieve high-quality analog devices or mixed-mode systems, while also providing an intuitive understanding of the radiated noise effect.},

  abstract = {Differential in a transmission system plays an important role of preventing the vehicle from slipping on curved roads. Mechanical differentials are heavy and bulky and are not suitable for electric vehicles especially those employing separate drives for both the rear wheels. Electronic differential constitutes a technological advance in electric vehicle design enabling better stability and control of the vehicle on curved roads. This paper presents modelling and simulation of an electronic differential employing a novel wavelet controller for two brushless DC motors ensuring the drive of the two rear wheels. The proposed controller uses discrete wavelet transform to decompose the error between actual and command speed as given by the electronic differential based on throttle and steering angle as the input into frequency components. These frequency components are scaled by their respective gains to generate a control signal which is given as input to the motor. To test the system, several simulations were carried out viz. vehicle on a straight road and vehicle driven on a road turning right and left. The results and comparison with conventional controllers like PID has been presented.},

Centrally controlled microgrids are susceptible to failures at high probability due to a single-point-of-failure, e.g., the central controller. True decentralization of microgrid architecture entails elimination of the central controller, attaining a parallel configuration for the system. In this paper, decentralized microgrid control architecture is proposed as a solution for reliability degradation over time, and analyzes the reliability aspects of centralized and decentralized control architectures for microgrids. Degree of importance of a single controller in centralized and decentralized architectures is determined and validated by Markov chain models. Results confirm that higher reliability is achieved when true decentralization of control architecture has been adopted. Challenges of implementing a true decentralized control architecture are discussed. Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation results for microgrid controller failure scenarios for both architectures are presented and discussed.},

Besides, the control scheme provides global asymptotic speed tracking in the presence of unknown parameters and load torque. For this purpose, the control scheme makes use of an improved method of speed estimation operating on the principle of a speed adaptive flux and current observer. As it is known, an observer is basically an estimator that uses a plant model and a feedback loop. In particular, an observer is constructed, which provides a speed estimation on the basis of the measured stator voltages and currents. Then a sliding-mode controller with an integral switching surface is considered. The closed-loop stability of the proposed controller is proved under parameter uncertainties and load disturbances, using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulated results show that the proposed controller, jointly with the proposed observer, provide high-performance dynamic characteristics and that this scheme is robust with respect to plant parameter variations and external load disturbances. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control scheme is proved by means of experimental results over a real induction motor},

In low power motors, the insulation degradation is principally due to the steep voltage variations caused by the voltage source converters that drive the machines. In the last years, with the coming to market of new no-Si based power devices, which achieve great values of dv/dt, fast tracking of electrical fault has became a topic of primary importance. In this paper, a new method to detect the presence of incipient faults in ultrareliable electric machines is presented and compared with a previous solution. The different methods were extensively evaluated by means of experimental results. It is shown that potential winding faults can be detected at an early stage of fault inception and thus measures can be taken to limit propagation.},

  abstract = {Given a dynamical system whose state equations include time-varying uncertain parameters, it is often desirable to design a state feedback controller leading to uniform asymptotic stability of a given equilibrium point. If, however, the controller operates on some estimate of the state, instead of the true state itself, it is of interest to know whether the desired stability will be preserved, e.g. suppose that the measured output is processed by a Luenberger observer. This paper concentrates on the scenario above and in addition, our analysis permits the controller to be non-linear. As a first step, inequalities are developed which have implications on the system's robustness; that is, when the uncertain parameters satisfy these inequalities, it becomes possible to separately design controller and observer. This amounts to an extension of the classical separation theorem to the case when the controller is non-linear. It is also of interest to note that the approach given here guarantees stability for some non-zero range of admissible parameter variations. This is achieved by introducing a certain ``tuning parameter'' into the Lyapunov function which is used to assure the stability of the combined plant-observer-controller system.},

The results demonstrate a significantly increased accuracy in the estimation of Rs and R'r, as well as load torque, flux, and velocity in transient and steady state, when compared with single EKFs or other approaches taken to estimate these parameters and states in the sensorless control of IMs. The improved results also motivate the utilization of the new estimation approach in combination with a variety of control methods which depend on accurate knowledge of a high number of parameters and states.},

As a solution to this problem, in this paper, the load torque and the rotor angular velocity are simultaneously estimated, with the velocity taken into consideration via the equation of motion and not as a constant parameter, which is commonly the case in most past studies. The estimation of load torque, on the other hand, is performed as a constant parameter to account for Coulomb and viscous friction at steady state to improve the estimation performance at very low and zero speed. The estimation algorithms developed based on the rotor and stator fluxes are experimentally tested under challenging variations and reversals of the velocity and load torque (step-type and varying linearly with velocity) over a wide velocity range and at zero speed. In all the scenarios, the current estimation error has remained within a very narrow error band, also yielding acceptable velocity estimation errors, which motivate the use of the developed estimation method in sensorless control of IMs over a wide velocity range and persistent zero-speed operation},

Some performance aspects of induction machines are also compared to permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). An overview of static efficiency maps is presented, but efficiency maps miss dynamic effects and under-predict induction machine efficiencies. The proposed evaluation method is based on dynamic efficiency under loss minimization and overall energy consumption over standard driving cycles that are provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Over each of these cycles, the dynamic efficiency and drive-cycle energy are determined based on experimental motor data in combination with a dynamic HEV simulator. Results show that efficiency in the fast-changing dynamic environment of a vehicle can be higher than inferred from static efficiency maps. Overall machine efficiency is compared for rated flux, and for dynamic loss-minimizing flux control. The energy efficiency given optimum flux is typically five points higher than for rated flux. This result is comparable to published PMSM results. A PMSM is also used for comparisons, and results show that both machines can perform well in HEV and EV applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The new observer differs from the conventional one by an integration path which provides additional degrees of freedom. This freedom can be used to make the observer-based controller design less sensitive to parameter variation of the system. It is shown that some of the difficulties that may arise in the exclusive pursuit of a design for the conventional observer-based controller from the point of view of system robustness are resolved in a straightforward manner using the PI observer. A systematic robustness recovery procedure is described for the PI observer-based controller design which asymptotically achieves the same loop transfer functions as the full-state feedback control implementation. A design example is included and the effectiveness of our method is illustrated by simulation results.},

Like any other PWM converter, the single phase PWM rectifier may be subject to different failures like power switch failures or sensor faults. Hence, fault diagnosis and monitoring are essential to optimize the maintenance costs and increase the reliability levels of the system. This paper discusses the fault detection and isolation (FDI) of both failures. A new open circuit fault detection and isolation approach is proposed. The fault detection method is based on residual generation between measured and observed current form factors (CFFs) with an adaptive threshold in order to avoid the false alarm and increase the reliability of the diagnosis algorithm. Also, the grid voltage sensor FDI is considered in this contribution thanks to the use of parity space equations approach. Moreover, after sensor fault detection and isolation, a grid virtual flux estimator is used to achieve the grid voltage sensor fault tolerance (FTC). Each failure may be detected in few hundred of microseconds. Theoretical analysis, simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {In recent years, marked improvement has been achieved in the design and manufacture of stator winding. However, motors driven by solid-state inverters undergo severe voltage stresses due to rapid switch-on and switch-off of semiconductor switches. Also, induction motors are required to operate in highly corrosive and dusty environments. Requirements such as these have spurred the development of vastly improved insulation material and treatment processes. But cage rotor design has undergone little change. As a result, rotor failures now account for a larger percentage of total induction motor failures. Broken cage bars and bearing deterioration are now the main cause of rotor failures. Moreover, with advances in digital technology over the last years, adequate data processing capability is now available on cost-effective hardware platforms, to monitor motors for a variety of abnormalities on a real time basis in addition to the normal motor protection functions. Such multifunction monitors are now starting to displace the multiplicity of electromechanical devices commonly applied for many years. For such reasons, this paper is devoted to a comparison of signal processing-based techniques for the detection of broken bars and bearing deterioration in induction motors. Features of these techniques which are relevant to fault detection are presented. These features are then analyzed and compared to deduce the most appropriate technique for induction motor rotor fault detection.},

  abstract = {The three-phase dual active bridge (3p-DAB) converter is widely addressed in emerging power systems applications such as solid-state transformer and dc microgrids. Its successful integration requires accurate modeling of its small-signal characteristics. Due to its dc-ac-dc structure, the DAB converter brings many challenges to small-signal modeling. The state-space averaging (SSA) has been the first proposed methodology to approximate the control-to-output and line-to-output transfer functions of the 3p-DAB. However, as shown in this paper, SSA is not precise for the stability analysis of 3p-DAB converters. A generalized state-space averaging (GSSA) model based on the dynamic phasor concept is developed in this paper for the Y-{$\Delta$} 3p-DAB. A hybrid SSA and GSSA model representation is then proposed for the evaluation of all the converter transfer functions. The developed models are validated with detailed time-domain switch-level simulations in an electromagnetic transient-type (EMT-type) program. They are also used for the accelerated stability prediction in an EMT-type program.},

  abstract = {The three-phase dual active bridge (3p-DAB) converter is widely considered in dc-grid applications. Because of the higher number of switches in the 3p-DAB, it can be argued that the reliability of the 3p-DAB is reduced when compared to other isolated-bidirectional dc-dc converter topologies. The previous work has shown that the 3p-DAB can be operated in a frozen leg fault-tolerant mode, i.e., with the two transistors of the same phase being opened by their gate driver internal protections. Because the free-wheeling diodes are left self-commutated, the analytical characterization of the converter for all voltage and loading conditions is not trivial. In this article, it is proposed to open the faulty phase such as it eliminates the interaction with the faulty-phase free-wheeling diodes. This allows the converter to fall in a characterizable operating mode for all voltage and loading conditions. The results further show that the open-phase operation provides advantages over the frozen leg operation in terms of current stress and power transfer capability. Experimental results on a small-scale closed-loop gallium nitride-based prototype as well as time-domain simulation results are provided to support the theoretical analyses.},

The studied microgrid has several renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and biomass power generation, being subject to different operational constraints and load demands. The proposed management policy guarantees that these demands are met at every sampling instant, despite eventual faults. This law is derived from the solution of an optimization problem that combines the formalism of a Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) scheme (to estimate faults) and a Model Predictive Control (MPC) loop (for fault-tolerant control goals); it chooses which energy source to use, seeking maximal profit and increased sustainability. The predictive controller part of the scheme is based on a linear time-varying model of the process, which is scheduled with respect to the fault estimation brought up by the MHE. Via numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed method, when compared to other MPC strategies, exhibits enhanced performances.},

The scope of the paper is focused on three-phase machines and it aims to present a simple and easy to tune control scheme for the system while it operates in degraded mode, namely when only two out of the three phases are operational. Compared to existing control strategy dedicated to degraded mode, this work proposes an innovative one using new reference frames. Based on two innovative transformations applied respectively to the currents and the voltages of the system, the proposed control scheme allows, in degraded mode, the decoupling control of the states of the system and leads to continuous controller references during system steady states. These properties lead to a very straightforward control scheme based on independent PI controllers and to high static and dynamic performances. The parameters setting of the controller is quite simple whatever the degree of magnetic coupling between the two remaining motor phases. A laboratory test bench has been built to establish a proof of concept of the suggested remedial strategy. It is based on a three-phase open-end-winding permanent magnet machine fed with a power inverter made of three full H-bridge. This experimental setup enables to validate the main operations of the ac motor drive under degraded mode operation: torque control, speed change. Switching between healthy mode and faulty mode is also performed successfully using this setup.},

Such power architecture is dedicated to electric vehicles in which it performs the three following essential functions: traction, battery charging, and electric-grid assistance. For safety reasons, in the degraded mode, power control is limited to the traction mode. Thus, for a given torque, the proposed innovative strategy uses a novel current/voltage transform that leads to efficient real-time control of the torque. The key idea is to drive the current without a priori restrictions on its waveform, while minimizing Joule losses, i.e., the effective value of the current. It has been validated on a laboratory test bench. The studied system is based on a three-phase open-end-winding synchronous machine powered by an inverter with three full H-bridges. The last section of the paper analyzes the comparison between the classic sinusoidal current waveforms and the proposed sinusoidal current waveforms while operating on the two remaining motor phases. It results in a 14\% increase of the torque produced by the permanent-magnet machine under test and a 14\% decrease of the global system losses in traction mode. As a result, the new control strategy enhances traction performance in degraded mode and increases electric-vehicle autonomy in a postfailure condition.},

Of course, many more special machines or specific applications can be investigated as well. However, with IMs, PMSMs, SRMs, and hydrogenerators, the most current industrial applications have been addressed. Most of the presented techniques are not yet fully used in industry and are still under evaluation before diffusion at a large scale in the industry. Therefore, many control techniques, such as FTC schemes, are still under investigation for industrial applications with reliability requirements. Even if there are no standard schemes to implement these modern control techniques, it has been commonly admitted that sensorless and fault-tolerant structures will be used more and more in the future and that they are fully implementable on low-cost digital platforms with a high degree of integration.},

The optimal interleaving angles have been identified for capacitor ripple reduction considering both modulation indexes and power factors pertaining to the traction motor's operating range. The dual three-phase inverter's switching losses have been analyzed for two different DC-link voltages and output power levels and a 15-20\% reduction in switching loss has been noted.},

To tackle the aforementioned weaknesses, in our previous work [1] we have presented a RISE formulation with a time-varying compensation gain to cope for the need of upper bound of the uncertain system. In this study, we have extended our previous design to obtain a fully self tuning RISE feedback formulation.

  abstract = {This book brings together emerging objectives and paradigms in the control of both AC and DC microgrids; further, it facilitates the integration of renewable-energy and distribution systems through localization of generation, storage and consumption. The control objectives in a microgrid are addressed through the hierarchical control structure. After providing a comprehensive survey on the state of the art in microgrid control, the book goes on to address the most recent control schemes for both AC and DC microgrids, which are based on the distributed cooperative control of multi-agent systems. The cooperative control structure discussed distributes the co-ordination and optimization tasks across all distributed generators. This does away with the need for a central controller, and the control system will not collapse in response to the outage of a single unit. This avoids adverse effects on system flexibility and configurability, as well as the reliability concerns in connection with single points of failure that arise in traditional, centralized microgrid control schemes.Rigorous proofs develop each control methodology covered in the book, and simulation examples are provided to justify all of the proposed algorithms. Given its extensive yet self-contained content, the book offers a comprehensive source of information for graduate students, academic researchers, and practicing engineers working in the field of microgrid control and optimization.},

Common approaches are either simple but inaccurate with deteriorated drive performance in the low-speed range, or they offer full torque even at zero speed at the cost of high implementation effort and parameter sensitivity. Moreover, most of the suggested solutions are tailor made for specific machine types. The proposed method constitutes a simple phase-locked-loop-type sensorless algorithm that can be related to the former category. The outstanding feature of the presented method is its effectiveness and simplicity at the same time. This paper presents corresponding design guidelines for an easy to implement and robust speed sensorless control algorithm for all kinds of electrical machines that includes induction machines as well as synchronous reluctance machines with and without extra/permanent excitation.},

  abstract = {The accelerated calendar and cycle life of lithium-ion cells was studied. Useful cell life was strongly affected by temperature, time, state-of-charge (SOC) and change in state-of-charge ({$\Delta$}SOC). In calendar life experiments, useful cell life was strongly affected by temperature and time. Temperature accelerated cell performance degradation. The rates of area specific impedance (ASI) increase and power fade followed simple laws based on a power of time and Arrhenius kinetics. The data have been modeled using these two concepts and the calculated data agree well with the experimental values. The calendar life ASI increase and power fade data follow (time)1/2 kinetics. This behavior may be due to solid electrolyte interface layer growth. From the cycle life experiments, the ASI increase data follow (time)1/2 kinetics also, but there is an apparent change in overall power fade mechanism when going from 3 to 6\% {$\Delta$}SOC. Here, the power of time drops to below 1/2, which indicates that the power fade mechanism is more complex than layer growth.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for the reconstruction of phase currents of an inverter-fed, three-phase induction motor from its dc link current. In conventional current-regulated induction motor drive, the phase currents are actually measured by using current sensors which are connected on the stator side. To reduce the number of sensors, different methods have been reported in literatures which are used for the reconstruction of phase currents from dc link current measurement. These methods are based either on the modification of pulse-width-modulation pattern or they consist of a machine model/load model-based observer and hence they have drawbacks like higher switching loss and increased sensitivity to parameter variations. The algorithm proposed in this paper makes use of simple logic gates and if{\textemdash}else statements and as a result, the drawbacks associated with conventional methods are eliminated. It also carries out auto-calibration of dc link current to remove the unwanted dc offsets that result due to asymmetry in switching of semiconductor devices. The proposed algorithm is tested on a 2.2 kW, current-regulated, field-oriented control, induction motor drive by using Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation results eshow good agreement between the reconstructed waveforms and actual waveforms under different operating conditions. This algorithm can be easily implemented by using any low-cost digital signal processor and one dc current sensor.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new control strategy for three-phase induction motor which includes speed and torque control loops and the current regulation thereby overcoming the limitation of volts per hertz control drives. For close-loop control, the feedback signals including the rotor speed, flux and torque are not measured directly but are estimated by means of an algorithm. The inputs to this algorithm are the reconstructed waveforms of stator currents and voltages obtained from the dc link and not measured directly on stator side. The proposed drive thus requires only one sensor in the dc link to implement the close-loop speed and torque control of a three-phase induction motor. Unlike the conventional flux and speed observers, the proposed estimation algorithm needs less computation and is less dependent on machine parameters. The proposed scheme is simulated using Matlab/Simulink software and is tested on a 2.2 kW drive for various steady-state and dynamic operating conditions. The results show fast dynamic response and good agreement between the actual values and the estimated values of torque and speed. Replacement of the open-loop control strategy of existing v/f drive by the proposed close-loop strategy appears to be possible without requiring any additional power components and sensors.

Two basic approaches will be considered, these apply differential algebraic and differential geometric tools. In the differential algebraic approach the state elimination methods will be used to derive nonlinear parity relations. In the specific case when a reconstruction of the fault signal is needed the dynamic inversion based approach will be investigated. This approach will also be studied from geometric point of view. The geometric approach, as proposed by Isidori and De Persis, is suitable to extend the detection filter and unknown input observer design approaches (well elaborated for LTI systems) to affine nonlinear systems. Beyond the development of the theory of fault detection and identification it is equally important to offer computable methods and to analyze the robustness properties against uncertainties. Both the observer based and the inversion based approaches will be elaborated for LPV systems that may offer computational tools inherited from linear systems and also allow to design for robustness utilizing results from H {$\infty$} robust filtering and disturbance attenuation.},

Promising approaches are closed-loop observers, as model reference adaptive systems (MRAS) and Kalman filters, and open-loop estimators, which have recently aroused lively interest because of their simplicity and low-cost profile. As known, open-loop algorithms use only motor equations to derive the speed estimation, whose accuracy turns out to be strictly related to the motor model and its parameters. This paper presents an improved open-loop speed estimation algorithm, which uses reference voltages and measured currents, after that a state-of-the-art dead time compensation has been performed. The often undervalued topic of parameter sensitivity is handled by an accurate mathematical investigation, confirmed by a complete set of both simulated and experimental results. The estimated speed is then used as feedback signal in a closed loop speed control, and a performance evaluation is accomplished as well.},

The results of the study allow determining the transition probabilities for the multi-state system Markov models of the fault tolerance, considering real operational conditions of an electric traction drive. The investigation and discussion of fault tolerance of the traction drive of an electrical helicopter serve as application case.

  abstract = {Electrified railway systems are the current focus of energy efficiency studies due to the increasing constraints of environmental sustainability policies. Railway System Operators (RSOs), also encouraged by market deregulation, are thus examining how to update infrastructures and vehicles and/or apply new operating strategies. Given the intrinsic relation between railway systems and their primary feeding grid, each measure applied to a railway system impacts directly on the power grid which supplies the system. Against this background, this paper aims to ascertain the impact of an energy efficiency strategy applied by the RSO system on its primary grid. The energy-efficient strategy is identified as to preserve timetable stability and service quality in a passenger-oriented perspective. Moreover, a method to model the interaction between the systems in terms of power flow exchanges is proposed. The model is used to verify how an eco-driving technique applied to a metro system affects the state variables of the distribution grid. In particular, the primary grid, the traction power substations and the railway system are modelled according to real data. The case study is the Metro Line 1 operating in the city of Naples (Italy). The numerical simulations are carried out with a two-step procedure: first, the power requirements of the rolling stock as a function of the imposed operating service are calculated by OpenTrack{\textregistered} software; the state variables of the distribution grid are then evaluated by means of the power flow approach.},

The effect of sensors faults on the IM vector control is presented, then, new detection and isolation approaches are suggested. Speed sensor faults are detected when an error between only two points from speed data exceeds a certain threshold. An algorithm based on RMS currents is developed to detect and isolate any faulty current sensor. This requires three current sensors, each per phase. Besides, open circuit faults of inverter power switches are taken into account too. To ensure continuous functionality of the drive, we conceived an Active Fault Tolerant Controller (AFTC) with smoother reconfiguration feature. Simulations in Matlab/Simulink are carried out to show the efficiency of the suggested schemes.},

In both Output and Input Fault Tolerant controller, the voting algorithm chooses the most appropriate output signal to ensure the best behavior in degraded mode. The performances are evaluated through simulations of a 7.5 kW Induction Motor drive with robustness testing against parametric variations, as well as under load testing. The results show that Euler, Newton-Raphson and Maximum Likelihood voting algorithms are more efficient than the Weighted Average in both Fault Tolerant Control schemes.},

The distinguished feature of this architecture is that it shows structurally how the controller design for performance and robustness can be done separately. It has the potential to overcome the conflict between performance and robustness of the traditional feedback framework. The controller design works in such a way that the feedback speed control of the induction motor will be solely controlled by the proportional integral PI controller for a nominal model without disturbances and H{$\infty$} robust controller will only be activated in the presence of the faults, the uncertainties or external disturbances. This FTC is applied to an induction motor drive for electrical vehicle. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid fault tolerant control architecture.},

  abstract = {The problem of multiplicative and/or additive fault detection and isolation (FDI) in the current sensors of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is considered in the presence of model uncertainty. A residual generator based on the DFIG model is proposed using the structure of the classical generalized observer scheme. However, each observer in this scheme is replaced by a robust H\_/H{$\infty$} fault detection filter followed by a Kalman-like observer. The latter further attenuates the effect of the modeling uncertainties on the residuals. It exploits the specific pattern induced by the balanced three-phase nature of all the electric signals. It turns out that the FDI problem then amounts to detecting an abrupt change in the mean of the residual vector in the additive fault case, or the appearance of sine waves superimposed on a white noise vector in the multiplicative fault case. A decision algorithm made of a combination of generalized likelihood ratio algorithms allows us to detect and isolate the additive and multiplicative sensor faults. The complete FDI system is tested through simulations on a controlled DFIG.},

If the number of different converter systems should be kept low, parallel operation of inverters is of interest. Thus, a master/slave architecture of an inverter system is presented which allows parallel operation of an arbitrary number of inverter modules by a simple control method. All inverter modules can be equal and no extra overall control unit is needed. The decision, which of the modules becomes master, is made via a single common status line automatically. The output current of the master is used as a command reference current for all slaves. It is shown that the master inverter module is able to stabilise the common output voltage independent of the number of slaves. Furthermore it is investigated how the load current and the reactive filter current is shared by the modules. Apart from results of a simulation, experimental work is presented which confirms the theory.},

The proposed method employs measurement of the current derivative at only one active-voltage vector at low speeds, and at one active-voltage vector and one zero-voltage vector at medium and high speeds during each pulsewidth modulation (PWM) cycle, in contrast to two active- and two zero-voltage vectors in the conventional FPE method. The theoretical analysis is developed based on the three-phase model of the machine. The rotor position and speed are estimated at PWM frequency. In addition, the selection voltage vectors for current derivative measurement as well as the pulse stretching scheme for extending and compensating the selected voltage vectors is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of the current derivative measurement and to minimize the current distortion. The experimental results show that the proposed method results in a considerable improvement of the estimation accuracy at low speeds, a significant reduction of current distortion compared to the conventional FPE method and a full-speed range operation from no load to full load.},

  abstract = {There is much confusion and uncertainty in the literature concerning the useable power capability of batteries and ultracapacitors (electrochemical capacitors) for various applications. Clarification of this confusion is one of the primary objectives of this paper. The three approaches most often applied to determine the power capability of devices are (1) matched impedance power, (2) the min/max method of the USABC, and (3) the pulse energy efficiency approach used at UC Davis. It has been found that widely different power capability for batteries and ultracapacitors can be inferred using these approaches even when the resistance and open-circuit voltage are accurately known. In general, the values obtained using the energy efficiency method for EF = 90{\textendash}95\% are much lower than the other two methods which yield values corresponding to efficiencies of 70{\textendash}75\%. For plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicle applications, the maximum useable power density for a lithium-ion battery can be higher than that corresponding to 95\% efficiency because the peak power of the driveline is used less frequently and consequently charge/discharge efficiently is less important. For these applications, the useable power density of the batteries can be closer to the useable power density of ultracapacitors. In all cases, it is essential that a careful and appropriate measurement is made of the resistance of the devices and the comparisons of the useable power capability be made in a way appropriate for the application for which the devices are to be used.},

(1992), the gain of the improved observer is function of the state estimate. A comparison of the proposed observer to that given by Gauthier et al.

Different methodologies based on current and vibration monitoring have been proposed using FFT and wavelet analysis for preventive monitoring of induction motors resulting in countless techniques for diagnosing specific faults, arising the necessity for a generalized technique that allows multiple fault detection. This work presents a novel methodology and its FPGA implementation for multiple fault online detection analyzing the current and vibration signals of an induction motor combining FFT and wavelet processing during its startup transient and steady state, precisely performing the identification of different faults like misalignment, unbalance, outer-race bearing defects and broken bars. The results obtained using the proposed methodology show its effectiveness providing a precise diagnosis of the induction motor condition.},

The proposed optimum control will select an optimum voltage vector from the whole hexagonal plane, leading to the best control performance fulfilling a predefined performance index. With the proposed concept, two subsolutions, i.e., both continuous and discrete solutions, are derived and unified in the frame of optimum control. The continuous solution utilizes the averaged continuous-time model of the system and is capable of dealing with multiple system constraints, showing good performance with less calculation efforts, while the discrete solution takes the finite set of the power converter switching vectors into consideration and the state transition of the system can be predicted with a chosen vector. Both methods require less calculation efforts compared with the well-known finite-control-set model predictive control method, which makes it very suitable for practical realizations. Finally, as a case of study, the proposed concept is tested at a current-controlled 3-kW surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor drive under different scenarios. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of both solutions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a static volt-ampere-reactive compensator (SVC) composed of fixed capacitor-thyristor controlled reactor (FC-TCR) is employed to regulate the terminal voltage of self-excited induction generator (SEIG) in the purpose of controlling the output power. In addition, the speed of the generator is adjusted by robust proportional-integral-derivative (PID) in order to regulate the frequency. Fractional order PID (FOPID) and Tilt-PID (T-PID) controllers are proposed to adjust the triggering angle of FC-TCR. The objectives of the paper are to design the optimal voltage controller with a robust PID frequency controller and to maintain the output power at a desired level in case of voltage sensor faults. In this regards, nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) and small signal models of the SEIG are constructed where triggering angle and generator speed are inputs, whereas terminal voltage and frequency are outputs, respectively. Training of the NARX model is achieved with a high regression value (R2\,=\,0.99) where the accuracy of the small signal voltage model is 82\%. After comparing the accuracy of the models, NARX-based fault detection architecture and fault tolerant controller are designed in order to avoid incorrect control of the output power. To establish the effectiveness of proposed fault tolerant controllers, simulation studies are conducted using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The designed controllers are performed experimentally on three-phase 5.5~kW, 400~V, 50~Hz, balanced loaded SEIG to confirm the effectiveness. The system is tested with proposed controllers under the healthy sensor, faulty sensor and dynamic reference conditions. Results give good agreement with simulation results and designed fault tolerant T-PID controller performs better tracking dynamics with small deviations whether the voltage sensor is faulty or not.},

This choice impacts the performance of the other components in the electric propulsion system. This study analyzes the performance of the designed induction motor with application in a light vehicle electric propulsion system. Through simulations using Advanced Vehicle Simulator software, the torque performance of a designed induction motor was compared with the other two traction permanent magnet motors, also designed for light vehicle applications. The characteristics presented in the catalog for each machine were compared. Acceleration/deceleration test simulations were made for three different gradeabilities. The induction motor delivered higher torques than both permanent magnet machines for more than 80 \% of the analyzed operation points. In the acceleration/deceleration tests, the designed induction motor presented higher instantaneous torques than those of the other permanent magnet machines. In the 4400 rpm to 6000 rpm overload region, the designed induction motor was more efficient than the permanent magnet machines. Therefore, this study shows that it is more advantageous to use this induction motor in light electric vehicle applications that require higher starting torques, such trajectories that contain ramps, and high slopes.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the problem of detection and isolation of open-switch faults in voltage source inverters by processing the stator current measurements. First, the resulting post-fault trajectories for the stator currents are analytically derived for single and concurrent faults (21 classes) by using Fourier series. This analysis motivated the proposed approach, which is based on the resulting pattern of the stator currents in the dq-frame after a fault, where a histogram of the trajectory is calculated by dividing the plane in 24 equally spaced sectors. From the calculated histogram, a distinctive signature is associated to each fault trajectory in the dq-plane. Single and double faults in the power semi-conductors are analysed that all provide linearly independent signatures for fault isolation. The proposed isolation methodology is independent of the load torque (system disturbance), supply frequency and only requires the information of the stator currents. Furthermore, since the isolation stage is focused on the angle of the current trajectories in the dq-plane, open- and closed-loop configurations of a variable speed drive can be simultaneously handled. Experimental results with a test bench of 3/4 HP induction motor under single and concurrent faults validated the proposed methodology.},

Residuals are synthesized by using nonlinear observers followed from a directional characterization. First, it is observed that the IM model can be written in a recurrent decoupled structure by taking the stator currents and mechanical velocity as outputs. In this way, residuals can be insensitive to load torque and operating conditions, and simultaneous faults can be addressed. A pulsewidth modulation three-phase inverter is studied as power actuator for the IM. Hence, in order to isolate faults related to the six switching devices, a directional residual evaluation in the -frame is employed. Hence, three residuals are constructed to isolate the faulty switches. The ideas presented in this paper are validated experimentally in a test bench of 1-hp IM under single and simultaneous faults.},

  abstract = {The existing energy management strategies for four-wheel-drive electric vehicles only take into account the vehicle energy consumption under static adhesion constraints. However, the front and rear axle loads transfer under dynamic conditions lead to the variations of vehicle adhesion characteristics, which results in the changes of vehicle energy consumptions. In this paper, a multi-objective optimal torque distribution strategy is proposed, taking into account the front and rear axle load transfer and the variations of adhesion characteristics. The advantages of the proposed strategy are verified through simulation studies in terms of vehicle energy consumption and wheel slip ratio, in comparison with the average torque distribution strategy and the optimal torque distribution strategy based on Sequential Quadratic Programming Algorithm. The simulation results show that the economy performance of the proposed strategy is superior to those of the competing methods. Furthermore, the proposed strategy provides good power performance and eliminates excessive wheel slip, which in turn ensures vehicle longitudinal stability and avoids energy loss resulting from frequent ASR interventions.},

  abstract = {Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) will become an inevitable trend in the future transportation network and have an important impact on the power grid. It is difficult to find the optimal distributed charging solution for AEVs to minimize the system cost with some uncertainties. In this paper, we investigate an AEVs charging and discharging problem with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. We aim to minimize the total electricity cost and battery degradation cost of AEVs and charging station batteries with V2G services, which takes the random arrival and departure of AEVs into account. We first propose a distributed charging framework of AEVs and charging stations by clustering method with the constraint of limited AEVs for each charging station in a region and formulate a distributed offline optimization problem. Then we formulate a distributed online charging optimization problem and propose a distributed online AEV charging scheduling (DOAS) algorithm to get an optimal charging solution. To study a more practical case, we reformulate the distributed online optimization problem with the uncertainties from base loads, renewable energy and charging demands. Furthermore, to improve the time efficiency of DOAS algorithm, we reduce the dimension of the distributed problem and design a dimension-reduction DOAS (DDOAS) algorithm. To seek a robust solution with some uncertainties, we propose a DDOAS algorithm with DRO based on Wasserstein distance (DDODW). Simulation results show that DOAS and DDOAS algorithms can have a close-to-optimal charging cost and a significantly less battery degradation cost of charging stations, compared with centralized online charging scheduling algorithm and DDOAS algorithm is more time-efficient than DOAS algorithm. The proposed DDODW algorithm can provide a robust solution for the energy schedule},

All of them had their specificities, but the last ones, starting in 2011, were more connected to relevant events organized on the topic. In fact, these events have been clearly the only international forums fully dedicated to diagnostics techniques in power electrical engineering. For this particular issue, it has been decided to separate the different submissions into six parts: state of the art; general methods; induction machines (IMs); synchronous machines (SMs); . electrical drives; power components and power converters. The second section includes only one state-of-the-art paper, which is dedicated to actual techniques implemented in both industry and research laboratories. The third section includes three papers on diagnostic techniques not specifically aimed at a particular type of machine. The fourth section includes three papers devoted to diagnostics of rotor faults, two dedicated to stator insulation issues, and four papers dealing with mechanical faults diagnosis in IMs. The fifth section includes papers focusing on different types of SMs. The first two papers deal with wound-rotor SMs, the following three papers are dedicated to permanent-magnet radial flux machines, and the last one deals with permanent-magnet axial flux machines. Regarding the types of faults analyzed, there are three papers devoted to the diagnosis of interturn short circuits in the stator windings, i.e., one dedicated to the detection and location of field-winding-to-ground faults and a paper devoted to the diagnosis of static eccentricities. In the sixth section, two papers investigate issues related to faults in drive sensors, and one is devoted to fault detections in the coupling inductors. The last section includes two- papers devoted to diagnosis of faults and losses analysis in switching components of power converters.},

  abstract = {Among the many opportunities offered by electric vehicles (EVs), the design of power trains based on in-wheel electric motors represents, from the vehicle dynamics point of view, a very attractive prospect, mainly due to the torque-vectoring capabilities. However, this distributed propulsion also poses some practical challenges, owing to the constraints arising from motor installation in a confined space, to the increased unsprung mass weight and to the integration of the electric motor with the friction brakes. This last issue is the main theme of this work, which, in particular, focuses on the design of the anti-lock braking system (ABS). The proposed structure for the ABS is composed of a tyre slip controller, a wheel torque allocator and a braking supervisor. To address the slip regulation problem, an adaptive controller is devised, offering robustness to uncertainties in the tyre{\textendash}road friction and featuring a gain-scheduling mechanism based on the vehicle velocity. Further, an optimisation framework is employed in the torque allocator to determine the optimal split between electric and friction brake torque based on energy performance metrics, actuator constraints and different actuators bandwidth. Finally, based on the EV working condition, the priorities of this allocation scheme are adapted by the braking supervisor unit. Simulation results obtained with the CarSim vehicle model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach.},

However, the necessary current reconstruction exhibits sensitivity to errors in the machine parameters, which has been documented during this investigation. This paper presents a technique for introducing a gated integrator into the controller gain amplifier that compensates for parameter errors using feedback information from all three of the phase currents during the periodic intervals when it is available. A numerical singularity in the current reconstruction algorithm during light-load operation is overcome by introducing an alternative first-order current estimator that is activated over narrow angular spans of the fundamental component vector rotation. This paper also presents an in situ technique to compensate gain differences between the three pilot devices in the inverter unit.

The proposed current estimation uses d- and q-axes currents and is independent of the switching states of the three-leg inverter. While the technique introduces a new concept of vector rotation to generate potential estimates of the currents, speed is estimated by one of the available model reference adaptive system (MRAS) based formulations. A logic-based decision mechanism selects the right estimate and reconfigures the system (by rejecting the signal from the faulty sensors). Such algorithm is suitable for different drives, including electric vehicles to avoid complete shutdown of the system, in case of sensor failure.

However, as is well known, the transient performance critically depends on the tuning of the gains of the proportional-integral (PI) velocity loop, a task which is rendered difficult because of the high uncertainty on the rotor resistance. The problem we address in this paper is how to develop an offline procedure to choose these gains. The main contribution of our work is a very simple frequency-domain test that, for each setting of the PI gains, evaluates the maximum range of the relative rotor resistance estimate for which global stability is guaranteed. In this way, we provide a quantitative estimate of the performance of the PI controller. The stability result may also be used in a dual manner, fixing now the range of the rotor resistance, and estimating an admissible interval for the PI gains that preserves global stability. Instrumental for our study is the exploitation of an energy dissipation (strict passivity) property of the system.},

The optimal planning takes into account various factors including the economics, reliability, and variability of renewables, network- and resource-based uncertainties, and adaptability to accommodate the prevailing operating concerns. A clustering-based method is considered for analyzing the variable data concerning the potential deployment of renewable energy in microgrids. The proposed interconnection planning methodology is applied to a six-microgrid system and the planning results are discussed. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed interconnection planning methodology will determine an optimal topology accurately and efficiently for a cluster of microgrids, and show that the proposed adaptive planning methodology can easily be applied to practical microgrid applications.},

Aimed at reducing ripple in the flux and the force, a duty ratio control scheme for direct thrust force control of linear permanent magnet synchronous motors is proposed. The effect of inverter voltage vectors on the flux and the thrust force is analyzed. Subsequently, a precise expression for the online computation of the required duty ratio is derived. Compared to the state-of-the-art duty ratio control, the proposed approach eliminates the need to tune gains. The proposed online duty ratio calculation is based on the selected voltage vector from the switching table and takes into account the mover's speed. The proposed approach retains the characteristics of the conventional direct thrust control in terms of fast transient and steady-state responses for both flux and thrust force. Experimental results demonstrate a faster transient response and negligible steady-state error for flux, force, and speed responses under the proposed approach when compared to the state of the art.},

By sufficiently exploiting the distribution information of incipient faults, this paper presents the reason why incipient faults cannot be detected by the existing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods. Under principal component analysis (PCA) framework, we propose a new data-driven FDD method, which is named probability-relevant PCA (PRPCA), for electrical drives in high-speed trains. The salient strengths of the PRPCA-based FDD method are: 1) it can greatly improve the fault detectability; it is suitable for non-Gaussian electrical drives; 2) based on the improved fault detectability, it can achieve accurate fault diagnosis via support vector machine; and 3) it can be easily applied to electrical drives even if neither physical models or parameters nor expert knowledge of drive systems is given; and it is of highly computational efficiency that can meet requirements on the real-time FDD. A set of experiments on a dSPACE platform-based traction system of the CRH2A-type high-speed train are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Due to the lack of the traditional mechanical differential, the right/left rear tractive forces and the corresponding rotational speeds cannot coordinate with each other automatically while cornering, which might increase the required steering angle and torque. An electric differential system is proposed in this paper to solve this problem. The proposed system controls the rotational speeds of both wheel motors according to different vehicle speeds and steering angles. A 12-degree-of-freedom 3W vehicle model, which is established in AutoSim and verified using the experimental data of the prototype vehicle, is used for the driver-in-the-loop verification in Matlab/Simulink. The preliminary result shows that the proposed system can effectively reduce the steering torques and roll angles during cornering.},

The conventional sensor control with inner current loop and outer voltage loop is often used to control the three-phase bridge converter. Many three-phase sensorless control methods had been proposed to control the bridge converter with considering the inductance and inductor resistance. In this paper, the voltage drop of the power semiconductor is first considered in the proposed three-phase current sensorless control method. At first, the dynamic behaviors of three-phase bridge converter for power factor correction (PFC) applications are studied, and its equivalent three-switch model is developed. Based on this developed model, three-phase current sensorless control with only voltage controller is proposed. Additionally, the voltage-loop transfer function of PFC bridge converter controlled by the proposed method is modeled, and the result is helpful to obtain the controller parameter. The proposed control method is implemented on the DSP-based platform for evaluation. Finally, the provided simulation and experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The connected vehicle paradigm empowers vehicles with the capability to communicate with neighboring vehicles and infrastructure, shifting the role of vehicles from a transportation tool to an intelligent service platform. Meanwhile, the transportation electrification pushes forward the electric vehicle (EV) commercialization to reduce the greenhouse gas emission by petroleum combustion. The unstoppable trends of connected vehicle and EVs transform the traditional vehicular system to an electric vehicular network (EVN), a clean, mobile, and safe system. However, due to the mobility and heterogeneity of the EVN, improper management of the network could result in charging overload and data congestion. Thus, energy and information management of the EVN should be carefully studied. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the deployment and management of EVN considering all three aspects of energy flow, data communication, and computation. We first introduce the management framework of EVN. Then, research works on the EV aggregator (AG) deployment are reviewed to provide energy and information infrastructure for the EVN. Based on the deployed AGs, we present the research work review on EV scheduling that includes both charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling. Moreover, related works on information communication and computing are surveyed under each scenario. Finally, we discuss open research issues in the EVN.},

First, the hybrid model (HM) of the motor drive system is established, and the current observer is designed according to the normal HM to detect the fault. This approach can eliminate the effects of speed and load transients and significantly improve the immunity to false alarms. The fault class is then judged according to the current vector phase to reduce the computation load and improve diagnostic reliability. Finally, the fault is isolated on the basis of the FOS technique, the possible fault types are simulated online using the HM, and the simulated residuals between the simulated and measured currents are used for fault isolation. The suggested method avoids extra sensors, is robust to false alarms, and has a relatively fast diagnosis speed. Simulations and experiments validate the proposed diagnosis scheme.},

  abstract = {A three-phase induction motor used as a propulsion system for the electric vehicle (EV) is a nonlinear, multi-input multi-output, and strong coupling system. For such a complicated model system with unmeasured and unavoidable disturbances, as well as parameter variations, the conventional vector control method cannot meet the demands of high-performance control. Therefore, a novel control strategy named least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) inverse control is presented in the paper. Invertibility of the induction motor in the constant control mode is proved to confirm its feasibility. The LSSVM inverse is composed of an LSSVM approximating the nonlinear mapping of the induction motor and two integrators. The inverse model of the constant -controlled induction motor drive is obtained by using LSSVM, and then the optimal parameters of LSSVM are determined automatically by applying a modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO). Cascading the LSSVM inverse with the induction motor drive system, the pseudolinear system can be obtained. Thus, it is easy to design the closed-loop linear regulator. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the mathematical model will change when the motor is under open-phase fault so that the coordinate transformations and control strategy should be redesigned accordingly in order to suppress the torque ripple. In this article, the postfault OW-PMSM system is remodeled considering the third harmonic flux. Based on the postfault model, new coordinate transformations are designed to obtain a concise torque and decoupling voltage expressions for the simple and accurate control of torque. Moreover, the torque ripple is suppressed by modifying the current reference. In addition, a simple decoupling modulation is designed to directly obtain the switching signals for the dual inverter. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control strategy.},

For two fault indicators in principal and residual subspaces, their probability density functions (PDFs) are estimated and used to determine reasonable thresholds for FDD. The proposed methodology extends the application of multivariate statistical technology to electrical traction systems.

Reliable fault-tolerant control strategy can promote the autonomous vehicle to maintain stability and path following accuracy in case of failure. In this paper, a passive fault-tolerant path following control method of autonomous distributed drive electric vehicle is presented considering the vehicle steering system fault. The reduced-order Kalman filter is applied to estimate the vehicle sideslip angle and the vehicle steering system fault. The hierarchical control strategy was developed, and in the upper layer controller, the adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed to facilitate the fault-tolerant path following controller and used to improve the lateral stability and anti-roll performance of vehicle and ensure path following accuracy at the same time, using the estimated sideslip angle and steering system fault as inputs. In the lower layer controller, a novel adaptive orientated tire force allocation method is proposed to execute the control efforts of upper layer controller. The simulations are implemented in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant path following control method is verified.},

This paper is an attempt to provide that analysis and performance comparison. It presents statistical characterizations of several digitally implemented, uniformly sampled, first-order PLLs for QAM modulation. Since a majority of the phase detectors used in QAM modulation are discrete time (e.g., decision directed) in nature, the digital PLL (DPLL) is the natural implementation of these carrier synchronization loops. The first-order DPLL when the modulation is an i.i.d. random sequence and when operating in the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN) produces a phase estimate that is a discrete time first-order Markov process, and the many tools for Markov analysis can be brought to bear on the performance analysis},

  abstract = {Saliency-based position sensorless drive with the pulse width modulation (PWM) switching frequency injection can achieve the high position estimation bandwidth. However, in order to obtain the rotor position, multiple currents should be sampled every PWM cycle to calculate the saliency reflected current difference. Considering the low-cost inverter using shunt resistors for phase current sensing, it is not possible to obtain this saliency current difference because machine current can only be measured once the low-side switch is ON. To implement the PWM injection sensorless drive on shunt-based sensing inverters, this paper proposes two modified PWM voltage controls for the measurement of saliency reflected current difference. The first modified PWM is based on the asymmetric PWM for both the field-oriented control (FOC) and position estimation. This proposed PWM requires only a single interrupt service routine (ISR); however, the current total harmonic distortion (THD) is higher. By contrast, the second modified PWM consists of both discontinuous PWM (DPWM) for FOC and asymmetric PWM for the position estimation. Although two ISR's are required for this proposed PWM pattern, the current THD is reduced through the separated PWM control. All the proposed PWM patterns are experimentally verified on an interior PM machine where the inverter with shunt resistors is used for current sensing.},

This would normally present difficulties for integration. This paper presents an IGBT gate driver IC with a collector current sensing circuit and an on-chip CPU for local data processing. This IC is prototyped using a TSMC 0.18 {$\mu$}m 40 V BCD Gen-2 process. The collector current sensing technique is based on the unique Miller plateau relationship between the gate current and collector current (IC and IG) for a particular gate resistance (RG). It allows a cycle-by-cycle measurement of IC during both turn-on and turn-off transients without any extra discrete components. The temperature variation is compensated internally by the on-chip CPU using polynomial curve fitting. This technique only monitors the low-voltage signal at the gate terminal, without the need to handle any high-voltage signal on the collector/load side. Measurements using a double pulse test setup show an accuracy of {$\pm$}0.5 A over the current ranges of 1-30 A for turn-on and 1-50 A for turn-off from 25 to 75 {\textdegree}C.},

The method uses two kinds of statistics to perform fault detection on the multi-dimensional data of the running gears. In addition, the characteristics of more accurate data are extracted, which greatly reduces the complexity of constructing a diagnostic and quantitative model. Further, by constructing a BRB model combining expert knowledge and data, it is possible to avoid misjudgment caused by data incompleteness. Compared with the traditional methods, the DSFA-BRB algorithm has better performance in reducing fault alarm probability. Finally, the validity of the algorithm is verified by the actual running gears system.},

In order to improve the safety and reliability of high-speed trains, this article deals with fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) problem for traction systems. Because of high sampling frequency of equipped sensors, FDD strategies in the supervision system of high-speed trains should be of enough high computation efficiency, which is a great bottleneck for artificial intelligence-based FDD methods. For reducing the computational load while maintaining the satisfactory diagnostic accuracy, an enhanced FDD architecture using the modified principal component analysis and broad learning system is developed in this article.

  abstract = {The choice of energy storage chemistry and battery management for transportation applications is at best challenging. The use of regenerative braking puts strain on some chemistries and the BMS (Battery Management System) needs to manage disparate criteria (temperature, altitude, maximum C rate, state of charge, cycle life, etc) to obtain maximum energy storage, round trip efficiency and safety. The different requirements of POWER needs compared with ENERGY needs are yet another set of constraints. The advent of PHEV (Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) adds more complication and the vision of V to G (Vehicle to Grid) complicates the matter significantly more. This paper reviews safety criteria for lithium ion battery chemistries system and then introduces criteria for matching the battery type to the BMS system. The question of why a computer notebook type BMS isn't the best choice for a vehicle is discussed. Since most vehicles can stop faster than they start, there is more kinetic power available with regenerative braking than the power necessary for accelerating the vehicle. This gives rise to either choosing symmetric charge-discharge chemistries or over designing for a non-symmetric case. The marriage of the battery energy storage system to the BMS/power electronics provides the system with efficiency, reliability, and safety. This marriage must be completely understood for optimized system design.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel phase current reconstruction scheme using the information obtained from shunt resistors (in series with low-side switches in a conventional three-phase inverter) for closed-loop current control in low-cost PMSM drives. A state observer is developed for reconstructing phase currents when they cannot be directly measured only in a portion of fundamental period due to the limitation of the bandwidth of signal conditioning circuits and minimum turn-on time of low-side switches. The observer is adaptive to variation of motor parameters and operation condition. By means of an integrating approach, i.e. using direct measurement at low MI and estimated currents from the observer at high MI, the reconstructed current feedback is sufficiently accurate for closed-loop current regulation. In addition, a fuzzy logic function is designed to achieve smooth transitions using trapezoidal weighting functions based on the instantaneous duty ratio of each phase, i.e. switching function. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is verified by experimental testing.},

The tuning rules for conventional PI controllers are mostly based on experience, Trial-and-error procedures are used to tune the values of the controller parameters. The relationship between the tuned controller parameters and the stable operating range of the control system is generally not known. The approach of this paper starts from establishing the complete dynamic models for a sensorless vector-controlled induction motor drive. The nonlinear dynamic models are linearized around a chosen operating point The characteristic equation is then derived, which is used to determine the values of the controller parameters corresponding to the marginal system stability. Based on these critical values, the tuning range of the controller parameters is obtained, which assures stable operation of the drive in the entire operating region and provides a reference for controller parameter tuning.},

The relaxed assumption, considering more practical situations, allows a bounded stator voltage and a finite absolute-integral of current tracking error. From this novel concept, a semi-current-fed model for induction motors is used for the design. Both unknown rotor resistance and torque load are considered along with immeasurable rotor flux. To cope with the problems, we use a virtual desired variable approach to synthesize the control law. In the absence of a flux sensor and not using a flux observer, the asymptotic speed tracking is ensured without needing the persistent excitation condition. However, if the controlled system is persistently excited, an optimal torque control is additionally achieved. In addition to the theoretical proof, experimental results show the expected tracking performance.},

It is theoretically and experimentally verified that a motor fault can be continuously tracked when the sensor errors are within a limited range through the adaptively determined threshold definition of noise conditions. The offline experiments are performed via Matlab using actual line-current data obtained by a data-acquisition system.

  abstract = {This paper describes a single current sensor control technique for induction motors that uses only a single DC-link current sensing resistor to obtain the information of three line currents. The principal motivation is to reduce the cost, and improve the reliability of a drive system. However, in certain conditions, the measurement is distorted due to the too narrow current pulse width in the shunt resistor. To solve this problem, a newly-created pulse width modulation strategy is developed and a dedicated observer is applied. The realization of single current sensor control technique is based on the ADMCF341, an embedded DSP with motor control peripherals and special ADC system. Test results are presented.},

However, the variability and intermittence of them is still a major concern in order to improve the reliability and efficiency of power systems. For this reason, it is needed to combine more than one renewable energy sources with conventional energy sources or energy storage systems. To this end, this study presents a brief review on the capacity sizing techniques, control strategies and energy management mechanisms in hybrid renewable energy systems. Not only the existing methods have been elaborated and compared, but also the feasible findings related to the possible challenges have been provided.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses the design of synchronous reference frame current controllers for a sensorless induction motor (IM) drive that operates in speed regulation mode or torque control mode. In most IM implementations, PI controllers alone are used for current regulation because of convenience. The reference values fed in the current controllers are either preselected or are synthesized by flux, speed or position regulators. Ideally, there should be no dependence between these two layers of controllers and their design should be done in successive steps. The current controllers are expected to force the currents to the reference values with good dynamics and no steady state error, irrespective of how the reference currents were generated. The paper shows that for a IM drive operating in speed control mode (where speed is commanded to a constant value), PI controllers alone are sufficient for proper current regulation. However, in torque control mode (where id is usually kept constant and iq is changed), the Pis alone can not regulate the currents. The analytical expressions of the current steady-state errors are derived. The proper controller design is to use compensation voltages in addition to the Pis - this eliminates the errors. The design of the decoupling compensators is reviewed. Additionally, the paper studies the current steady-state error when compensation is attempted with improper motor parameters.},

The design is done using a modified model of the motor in the rotating reference frame. The inputs of the observer are the voltages and currents in the dq frame, and an estimate of the speed (which is not necessarily accurate). Using a speed estimate allows us to eliminate the speed measurement and yields a sensorless observer. The novelty is that, despite using an inaccurate input speed, the design of the feedback gains allows us to obtain an accurate flux estimate. The sliding mode observer is compared with a similar open-loop flux observer-it is shown that the proposed design is much more robust to parameter variations. The theoretical derivations are supported with simulations and experimental waveforms.},

Stability and dynamics of the two proposed SM flux observers are discussed. The observers are compared with the classical MRAS observer. The proposed estimators seem very robust and easy to tune. Unlike the classical MRAS, the speed-estimation process is based on algebraic calculations that do not exhibit underdamped poles or zeros on the right-hand plane.

Such systems experience bus voltage stability challenges owing to the negative incremental resistance of constant power loads and converter control loop interactions. To tackle the stability challenges, this paper presents the application of the interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) approach to the port-controlled Hamiltonian model of dual active bridge (DAB) source-side converters in an MVdc microgrid. For the DABs, a fundamental average model approach considering phase shift modulation is provided and used for deriving the corresponding IDA-PBC control law. We analyze the effectiveness of the controller on large signal scenarios considering disturbances such as load step up, and DAB disconnection. Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments using Opal-RT and Labview field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), as well as, low power prototype tests are carried out to demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Since position and current information is typically indispensable for PMSM control strategies such as vector control or direct torque control, failure of an encoder/resolver or current sensors could lead to a catastrophic failure, if no protection or backup plan is established. This paper lays groundwork for developing a novel backup universal sensor concept for PMSM with position and current estimation. Estimated position and current could be used for sensor fault detection or survivable drive, giving its drive system a ``+1'' fault tolerance. This technique uses search coils, which are implemented to directly monitor magnetic flux through stator teeth. Adaptive position estimator and a current estimator have been designed based on the search coil model, which overcomes the issue of resistance variation that exists in many estimators reported in literature. Simulation and experimental verification are presented to verify feasibility of the proposed strategy.},

In this paper, a sensorless antilock braking system (ABS) for brushless-motor in-wheel EVs is proposed. The proposed solution omits the need for installation of separate conventional ABS sensors at each corner of the vehicle. This paper also shows, both theoretically and experimentally, that the general form of a conventional ABS sensor output voltage is identical to a brushless dc (BLDC)-motor back electromotive force. The proposed sensorless system can reduce the costs of manufacturing and maintenance of the vehicle and significantly improves the performance of the ABS by accurate wheel speed estimation and road identification using wavelet signal processing methods. The sensorless system was extensively tested using actual ABS hardware. Those experiments showed that the accuracy of the proposed sensorless wheel speed estimation for BLDC propulsion was higher than that of commercial ABS sensors. In addition, sensorless ABS for brushless propulsion was compared with that of brushed dc motor, and the results showed that the brushless sensorless ABS achieved better accuracy, robustness, and reliability compared with the sensorless ABS for brushed dc motor.},

Since open-switch fault and output current sensor fault both affect the residual of output phase current, it is difficult to identify them apart from each other.

The finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) method is applied in the MC-based PMSM drive system. The fault identification method is proposed based on the extracted different faulty features of the open-switch fault and the output current sensor fault. After the open-switch fault is separated from the current sensor fault, an error-voltage-based open-switch fault diagnosis strategy is applied to locate the faulty switch. Hardware-in-the-loop tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The formulation of the current estimator for the FTC scheme is accomplished in a stationary reference frame. This choice does not necessitate slip or synchronous speed information, simplifying the FTC structure. Besides, the fault detection process is independent of the machine model. Even partial sensor fault conditions like gain-drop and dc offset can be detected satisfactorily using such an operator. The proposed concept of FTC for IVC-IM drive is validated experimentally with a 5.5-kW IM drive laboratory prototype by conducting different case studies, including the cases of partial sensor failure.},

This paper assesses the extent to which projected sea-level rise is likely to impact upon the functioning of the Dawlish to Teignmouth stretch of the London to Penzance railway line, in England. Using a semi-empirical modelling approach, we identify a relationship between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years and then use model-based sea-level predictions to extrapolate this relationship into the future. We find that days with line restrictions (DLRs) look set to increase by up to 1170\%, to as many as 84{\textendash}120 per year, by 2100 in a high sea-level rise scenario (0.55{\textendash}0.81 m). Increased costs to the railway industry deriving from maintenance and line restrictions will be small ({\textsterling} millions) in comparison with damage caused by individual extreme events ({\textsterling}10s of millions), while the costs of diversion of the railway are higher still ({\textsterling}100s of millions to billions). Socio-economic costs to the region are likely to be significant although they are more difficult to estimate accurately. Finally, we explain how our methodology is applicable to vulnerable coastal transport infrastructure worldwide.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a model-based strategy for stator-interturn short-circuit detection on induction motors is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the generation of a vector of specific residual using a state observer. The vectorial residual is generated from a decomposition of the current estimation error. This allows for a fast detection of incipient faults, independently of the phase in which the fault occurs. Since the observer includes an adaptive scheme for rotor-speed estimation, the proposed scheme can be implemented for online monitoring, by measuring only stator voltages and currents. It is shown that the proposed strategy presents very low sensitivity to load variations and power-supply perturbations. Experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting incipient faults, including a low number of short-circuited turns and low fault current.},

  abstract = {Transport and vehicular travel are essential for socio-economic growth, as they enable the operation of cities and businesses globally. However, large percentages of the transport sector currently rely on internal combustion engine vehicles, causing an increase in greenhouse gases and air pollution. Electric vehicles provide a promising solution to the issues faced by the transport sector. As a result, optimization of the electric vehicle powertrain is a key area, with the traction motor control mechanism forming a major component of the powertrain. Consequently, this paper aims to review the novel control techniques which have been applied to the traction motor system in electric vehicles. Direct torque control and indirect field oriented control are commonly applied control techniques as they allow for advanced control of the induction and permanent magnet synchronous motors currently used in most of the electric vehicles being produced. In general, various improvements have been made to conventional direct torque control and indirect field oriented control schemes, in order to reduce ripple and improve parameter insensitivity. While efforts are still being carried out in these areas for electric vehicle applications, it was found that there has been a large emphasis placed on powertrain efficiency improvement through optimization of the traction motor control system. Efficiency improvements have recently been achieved through optimal selection of stator flux and DC link voltage values. Research into efficiency improvement is likely to continue as extended vehicle range can be achieved.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a novel nine-level multilevel inverter topology with an instantaneous voltage balancing scheme of stacked dc-link capacitors for an induction motor (IM) drive application. Three neutral points (NPs, terminal joints of four series-connected capacitors) across a single dc-link are balanced instantaneously (within a sampling interval) by ensuring zero current at the NPs. The proper selection of pole voltage from the redundancies provides zero current at any NP during the pulsewidth modulation operation under a steady-state and transient operation. A five-level stacked inverter and three cascaded hybrid-bridge (CHB) inverter cells are used in each phase. Along with the balancing of dc-link capacitors, CHB capacitors' voltage balancing is also achieved using the pole voltage redundancies at all modulation indexes for all power factor and load. It is also possible to increase more number of levels using more low-voltage switches, and a generalized form of the topology is presented. The concept is validated using a laboratory-developed nine-level inverter with a three-phase IM load, operated under ``V/f'' control. The detailed experimental results for the steady and transient condition, simulation studies for switching loss, and harmonic content in the phase voltage are also presented.},

The scheme is employed for the purpose of sensorless fault-tolerant torque-controlled drives used in a limp-home mode operation in electric vehicle (EV) applications. The proposed scheme was experimentally tested on a laboratory dynamometer using a 19-kW IM and a 29-kW controller, which are both currently used in the automotive industry for EV applications. The scheme was also implemented on an electric golf buggy which was equipped with a 5-kW IM. A performance comparison was carried out between the proposed and conventional back-EMF MRAS schemes for starting from standstill, sensitivity to parameter variations and constant speed operation with load variations. Utilizing the golf buggy, the behaviors of the new scheme was separately investigated for vehicle starting from standstill, wide speed range including field weakening region, and hill-starting operations. The proposed scheme is computationally easy to implement, robust against sensitivity to parameters variations, inverter nonlinearity and errors due to digitization in the field weakening region. This scheme is not only consistent for vehicle starting from standstill, it also provides a reliable vehicle-drive in the field weakening region and during vehicle hill-starting. The dynamometer and vehicle test-drive results show the suitability of the proposed scheme for the purpose of EV fault-tolerant limp-home mode operation.},

  abstract = {This chapter will discuss the behaviour of the system of linear simultaneous equations {$\mathsl{A}\mathsl{x}$}={$\mathsl{b}$}Ax=b Ax = b when the matrix A and the vector b are subjected to small order perturbations {$\increment$}A and {$\increment$}b respectively. The problem then becomes ({$\mathsl{A}$}+{$\Delta\mathsl{A}$})({$\mathsl{x}$}+{$\Delta\mathsl{x}$})={$\mathsl{b}$}+{$\Delta\mathsl{b}$}(A+{$\Delta$}A)(x+{$\Delta$}x)=b+{$\Delta$}b {\textbackslash}left( \{A + {\textbackslash}Delta A\} {\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}left( \{x + {\textbackslash}Delta x\} {\textbackslash}right) = b + {\textbackslash}Delta b and we are mainly concerned with studying the deviation {$\increment$}x of the solution with the perturbation. Such an exercise is called sensitivity analysis, for the extent of the deviation {$\increment$}x relative to {$\increment$}A and {$\increment$}b defines the sensitivity of the system. A highly sensitive system is roughly one where a relatively large deviation {$\increment$}x is incurred by small perturbations {$\increment$}A and {$\increment$}b. As we shall see, highly sensitive systems are generally to be avoided in practice. They are referred to as ill-conditioned, for a highly sensitive system would yield large variations in the results for only small uncertainties in the data. To clarify this fact, let us study the behaviour of the system of equations {$\mathsl{x}$}+{$\mathsl{y}$}=2x+y=2 x + y = 2 0.49{$\mathsl{x}$}+0.51{$\mathsl{y}$}=10.49x+0.51y=1 0.49x + 0.51y = 1 {\textemdash} representing a pair of straight lines intersecting at x = 1, y = 1 {\textemdash} when a small term {$\epsilon$} is added to the equations. Surprisingly enough, the set of equations obtained, namely {$\mathsl{x}$}+{$\mathsl{y}$}=2+{$\mathsl{E}$}x+y=2+{$\epsilon$} x + y = 2 + {\textbackslash}varepsilon 0.49{$\mathsl{x}$}+0.51{$\mathsl{y}$}=10.49x+0.51y=1 0.49x + 0.51y = 1 represents a pair of straight lines meeting at a point (x, y) given by x = 1 + 25.5{$\epsilon$}; y = 1 - 24.5{$\epsilon$}, and rather distant from x = 1, y = 1. Here, a small change of order {$\epsilon$} in the equations has produced a change of 25{$\epsilon$} in the solution. This system has definitely a high sensitivity to perturbations in its matrix A and vector b.},

Electric drives use several current and voltage sensors for control and protection. The principal objective of the strategy is to detect faults in DC-Link sensors, since the conclusion of a preliminary study showed that in some applications many functionalities in the control strategy depend on it. Although it was mainly designed for DC-Link sensors, thanks to the FDI structure presented here, the algorithm is able to detect faults in other sensors. The strategy is based on state observers and has been validated through real time simulations in a Hardware-in-the-Loop platform. The principal components of the platform are an OPAL-RT real time simulator and a commercial traction control unit.},

  abstract = {In the last decades, many vector control techniques have been developed for induction machine to increase their dynamic performances. But they are based on an accurate estimation of flux variables, which are not measurable in conventional induction machines. So, observer strategies are used in induction machine controls. Complex algorithms have been developed, but their long calculation time does not allow a simple implementation in digital form. For this reason, reduced-order observers are often used when a real-time estimation is implemented. If these structures lead to better flux estimations than in the case of an open-loop model, their convergence gains have to be determined and they are sensitive to the parameters value. The authors present a new analytical method to elaborate a reduced-order observer. The influence of the sampling rate is taken into account and the paper investigates the optimal gain, which minimise the sensitivity to the parameters value. In order to measure the observer robustness, the authors define two criteria, which are computed in steady state: the orientation error and the modulus error of the rotor flux. Some examples illustrate the theory and their calculation results are presented.},

  abstract = {Dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter based on single-phase shift (SPS) modulation is commonly used in energy storage systems. However, if the normalized voltage gain deviates from unity, the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) feature and efficiency of the DAB converter deteriorate. To overcome this challenge, this article proposes a hybrid-bridge and hybrid modulation-based DAB converter adapted to a wide voltage range. The primary-side hybrid bridge operates in an intermediate state between the full bridge and the half bridge. Asymmetrical pulsewidth modulation (APWM) is introduced to regulate the dc bias across the blocking capacitor in a continuous manner. Due to the synergy between the hybrid-bridge structure and hybrid modulation scheme, a general voltage match between the energy storage unit and the high-voltage bus is always achieved. Moreover, the ZVS range is extended and the circulating current is well suppressed. Therefore, efficiency is optimized over the wide voltage range. The operational principles, circuit modeling, and design considerations are detailed. A 500-W converter prototype, linking a 100{\textendash}200-V energy storage unit and a 300-V dc bus, is designed and tested to validate the concept. A 97.9\% peak efficiency and good overall efficiency over the wide voltage range are reported.},

  abstract = {An electric drive is an electromechanical conversion device, consisting of an electrical machine, a power electronic inverter, which interfaces between the machine and the electrical supply, a set of sensors and a digital electronic controller. Drives of this sort are manufactured in high volumes at power levels ranging from less than 1W to many MW. Reliability of the complete system depends upon the local environment, levels of thermal cycling and predictive maintenance schedules. Overall the drive system has a typical reliability of the order of 10-5 failures per hour, making it much more reliable than, say, an internal combustion engine. As part of the ``electrical revolution'' electric drives are increasingly being developed for safety critical applications, where their reliability is several orders of magnitude below the application requirements. This is particularly the case in electrical propulsion and actuation systems in aircraft, leading to intensive research into fault tolerant electric drives. This paper will illustrate some of the most common failure mechanisms and the consequences of such failures. It will then progress to examine architectures which are fault tolerant through partitioning of the drive into several independent lanes and examine the penalties of adopting such an approach. The paper will discuss pros and cons of different fault tolerant architectures and suggests future research and development steps that are required to increase the overall safety of electric drives.},

PV systems with auxiliary power sources and local loads are used for MTDC connection, especially when ac utility grid is integrated with it by voltage source converters. Pole to pole and pole to ground faults are basically considered as dc distribution network hazards. As PV is connected through dc cable, high resistive dc arc fault is also studied in present literature. The proposed PV system is considered with arc-fault circuit interrupters as backup protection and is used to detect arcing series fault. Fast acting dc switching is considered for proposed differential current-based unit protection. A discrete frame differential current solution is considered to classify the fault type by modified cumulative sum average approach. By calculating unknown dc cable resistance accurately by non-iterative Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse technique, the fault distance is calculated. TMS320C6713 DSP based test-bench is used for verification of the scheme.},

  annotation = {A large number of adjustable speed drives in industry and emerging applications require high dynamic performances, robustness against parameter variation and also reliability. Parameter detuning and mechanical speed sensor faults lead to a deterioration of the performances and even to instability. Therefore condition monitoring is becoming mandatory. Using knowledge of the motor condition, a fuzzy-based approach is applied to discriminate load and parameter variations from the speed sensor faults. Both simulation and experimental results are presented in terms of accuracy in the detection of speed sensor faults and knowledge extraction feasibility. The study reported in this paper is also concerned with the development of a drive tolerant to the speed sensor failure. The proposed system adaptively reorganizes itself to sustain the best control performance. The control reorganization is managed by a voting algorithm system that assures smooth transition from the nominal controller to the sensorless one and back to the encoder-based controller. Simulations tests using collected experimental data, in term of speed and torque responses, have been carried out on a 1.2 kW induction motor to evaluate the consistency and the performance of the proposed fault-tolerant control approach},

  abstract = {This paper describes a sensorless control for a high-performance permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive. A differential algebraic approach is used to estimate the position (and speed). The relationship thus obtained for analytical estimation of the position is based on the control voltages, the measured currents, and their derivatives. Unlike the other estimators like the extended Kalman filter (EKF) that is complex and computationally expensive, the differential algebraic estimator is simple with a 1-D model. Global convergence of the estimator is demonstrated, and experimental results show the effectiveness of the method and its robustness to current sensor fault.},

  abstract = {Software defined radios (SDR) are highly configurable hardware platforms that provide the technology for realizing the rapidly expanding third (and future) generation digital wireless communication infrastructure. While there are a number of silicon alternatives available for implementing the various functions in a SDR, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive option for many of these tasks for reasons of performance, power consumption and flexibility. Amongst the more complex tasks performed in a high data rate wireless system is synchronization. This paper examines carrier synchronization in SDRs using FPGA based signal processors. We provide a tutorial style overview of carrier recovery techniques for QPSK and QAM modulation schemes and report on the design and FPGA implementation of a carrier recovery loop for a 16-QAM modern. Two design alternatives are presented to highlight the rich design space accessible using configurable logic. The FPGA device utilization and performance for a carrier recovery circuit using a look-up table approach and CORDIC arithmetic are presented.

Autonomous vehicles, as studied in this paper, are very suited to accomplish missions in confined space or in hostile environments (in radioactive environments and spatial programs), where the success of the mission is more important than the cost of the additional actuators. The proposed FDI approach provides an early detection of the faults, allowing safe reconfiguration of the system control. Cosimulation results using experimental data show the performances and advantages of the presented approach.},

The first controller is designed using the equivalent control method. The second controller is based on a discrete-time equivalent of the super-twisting algorithm, in which the sliding-mode dynamics is robustified by adding an integral action. The nonmeasurable rotor fluxes are estimated by two observers. The first observer design is based on a simple copy of the rotor flux dynamics, whereas the second observer design is based on the sliding-mode technique. A simulation study was carried out for the evaluation of the closed-loop performance of the IM at different sampling periods and to compare results with other discrete-time control techniques. Moreover, the robust performance of the closed-loop IM is investigated under external and internal perturbations. The simulation study predicts that the IM, when in closed-loop with one of the proposed controllers, still performs well at a sampling time of 1250 {$\mu$}s, whereas other control strategies start to lose accuracy. Real-time experiments were finally carried out, where the good performance of the proposed strategy is verified.},

A Lagrangian is first formulated for the IM, where the corresponding discrete Lagrangian is derived based on the one-point quadrature rule integration method (in this case, the variational integrator is known as symplectic Euler). Then, a discrete action principle is applied, which guarantees the optimum path in a discrete-time setting. The forcing and dissipation are added by using the discrete Lagrange d'Alembert principle. Finally, discrete-time update rules are obtained for IMs. Then, theoretic properties such as relative degree and steady state are studied for the continuous-time symplectic Euler and explicit Euler models. Simulations are carried out for different sampling periods, where results are compared with a discrete-time model obtained with the classical explicit Euler method. It is put in evidence that the symplectic Euler model approximates better the IM dynamics than the model obtained with the classical Euler method.},

However, most of the available and published controllers assume that the Hall signals are always available, which is not true if any of the sensors are faulted. In this paper, several fault-tolerant control schemes for BLPM motor drives are proposed. The methodology is based on fault diagnosis and its classification, and subsequent signal reconstruction. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed fault-tolerant schemes in restoring the motor operation when failures occur in up to two Hall sensors. The proposed fault-tolerant schemes can be easily and flexibly realized for conventional drive systems, either by adding the code in the existing driver or by adding a simple auxiliary circuit between the Hall sensors and the driver.},

However, the distributed control method based on distributed communication network usually involves communication delay, which may lead to the failure of the controller in the practical application and even affect the stability of the system. This paper introduces a novel distributed secondary control algorithm without droop control, which can be used to realize voltage recovery and load sharing simultaneously. Based on this, two stability criteria under different conditions are derived for the dc microgrid system considering communication time delay, which are delay-dependent stability criterion under constant delay and time-varying delay-dependent stability criterion by using linear matrix inequality (LMI). These stability criteria are helpful to guide the selection of control parameters. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy, and show the correctness of the delay-independent stability criterion and delay-dependent stability criterion.},

What is not so well appreciated is that a GIS can serve as a software/data management system that integrates software (in-house and third-party) with data (in a variety of formats) to form a unified display/analysis tool. Analysts can continue to use the software with which they are familiar, while concurrently gaining access to the additional capabilities offered by the GIS. This paper illustrates these points by describing the Marine Geophysics Modeling System that was developed to aid in the analysis and display of marine geophysical data.

In other words an observer for a SISO plant with unknown input can be designed if and only if the plant is of unity relative degree and the numerator of the transfer function is Hurwitz. These conditions have an interesting consequence in the context of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) for the case of relative degree one, in the sense that strictly real positive (SPR) condition for the model reference is not needed.},

Due to their inherent fault-tolerant capability against open-phase faults (OPFs), drives with multiple three-phase windings are ideal candidates in such applications and for this reason many efforts have been devoted to the development of different fault-tolerant control strategies. Fault detection is, however, a previous and mandatory stage in the creation of fault-tolerant drives, and the study of specific OPF detection methods for six-phase drives is still scarce. Taking advantage of the secondary currents (so called x-y currents) that are unique in multiphase machines, this study proposes new fault indices that detect and locate the OPFs without additional hardware. The method proves to be simple and independent of the operating point, control technique, and drive parameters. Comparative experimental results confirm the capability of the proposed method to achieve fast detection times with good robustness.},

The magnitude and the orientation angle of the rotor flux of the IM are determined by the output of the closed-loop rotor-flux observer based on the calculation of the extended electromotive force of the machine. The proposed rotor-flux-oriented control scheme is robust to parameter variations and external disturbances. Both observer and controller utilize the continuous sliding mode and Lyapunov theory. A smooth transition into the field-weakening region and the full utilization of the inverter current and voltage capability are thus possible. The produced torque is a continuous output variable of control. The performance of the proposed method is investigated and verified experimentally on a digital signal processor.},

The main contributions are the derivation of a measure, distinguishability, and a method for analyzing fault diagnosability performance of discrete-time descriptor models. The method, based on the Kullback{\textendash}Leibler divergence, utilizes a stochastic characterization of the different fault modes to quantify diagnosability performance. Another contribution is the relation between distinguishability and the fault to noise ratio of residual generators. It is also shown how to design residual generators with maximum fault to noise ratio if the noise is assumed to be i.i.d. Gaussian signals. Finally, the method is applied to a heavy duty diesel engine model to exemplify how to analyze diagnosability performance of non-linear dynamic models.},

  abstract = {Smart grid has modernized the way electricity is generated, transported, distributed, and consumed by integrating advanced sensing, communications, and control in the day-to-day operation of the grid. Electricity is a core utility for the functioning of society and for the services provided by information and communication technologies (ICTs). Several concepts of the smart grid, such as dynamic pricing, distributed generation, and demand management, have significantly impacted the operation of ICT services, in particular, communication networks and data centers. Ongoing energy-efficiency and operational expenditures reduction efforts in communication networks and data centers have gained another dimension with those smart grid concepts. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the smart grid-driven approaches in energy-efficient communications and data centers, and the interaction between smart grid and information and communication infrastructures. Although the studies on smart grid, energy-efficient communications, and green data centers have been separately surveyed in previous studies, to this end, research that falls in the intersection of those fields has not been properly classified and surveyed yet. We start our survey by providing background information on the smart grid and continue with surveying smart grid-driven approaches in energy-efficient communication systems, followed by energy, cost and emission minimizing approaches in data centers, and the corresponding cloud network infrastructure. We discuss the open issues in smart grid-driven approaches in ICTs and point some important research directions such as the distributed renewable energy generation capability-coupled communication infrastructures, optimum energy-efficient network design for the smart grid environment, the impact of green communication techniques on the reliability and latency requirements of smart grid data, workload consolidation with smart grid-awareness, and many more.},

  abstract = {Integration of the advances in information and communication technologies to the power grid technologies is changing the architecture and operation of the traditional grid, leading the grid to gradually evolve into a smart grid. Generation in the smart grid will be different than it is in today's grid, mainly due to the high penetration level of distributed renewable power generators. The distributed generator (DG) is favorable for its low transmission losses and low emissions. On the other hand, control of a high number of DGs is challenging. Almost a decade ago, microgrids were proposed to tackle the challenge of handling the growing number of DGs and fault isolation. A microgrid is a medium voltage or low voltage electrical power system that contains DGs, storage units, controllable loads, small-scale combined heat and power units, and an energy management system. In this article, we revisit the microgrid concept in light of survivability approaches borrowed from high-speed networks. We provide an analogy between survivability in metroaccess networks and reliability of the overlay topology for the smart microgrid network (SMGN). We develop the idea of resource sharing among smart microgrids for the sake of increased reliability. In our case, reliability corresponds to supplying power to the loads using the energy generated in the SMGN, without importing power from the utility grid. We provide a reliable overlay topology design scheme that maximizes the usage of renewable energy in the SMGN.},

Faulted leg isolation and redundant leg insertion are done by using independent back-to-back-connected thyristors. The proposed inverter provides tolerance to both short-circuit and open-circuit faults of the switching devices. The postfault performance is the same as the normal prefault operation and fault compensation is fast enough such that there is negligible disturbance in the drive operation.

  abstract = {Modern electric drives use a self-commissioning procedure to precisely identify motor parameters for achieving high-performance control. Typically, the induction motor magnetizing curve is identified using no-load rotational test. However, some applications necessitate the electric drive to identify the magnetizing curve at standstill conditions. As one of the well-known standstill approaches, the traditional flux integration exhibits several practical problems. Any imperfection in measured current, estimated stator resistance, and dead-time compensation directly affects the accuracy of the estimated magnetizing curve because of error accumulation in open-loop integration. This paper proposes a robust yet simple solution against those practical concerns. It can identify the magnetizing curve without using any dead-time compensation and stator resistance. Only industry-standard dc-link voltage and phase current measurements are used. Its superior features are experimentally verified on a number of motors and the results are confirmed by no-load rotational test results. Its robustness against current offset and extra longer integration duration is also proved.},

First, each measurement-vector coming from each sensor is fed to a fuzzy logic-based adaptive Kalman filter (FL-AKF); thus there are N sensors and N FL-AKFs working in parallel. The adaptation in each FL-AKF is, in the sense of dynamically tuning the measurement noise covariance matrix R, employing a fuzzy inference system (FIS) based on a covariance matching technique. A second FIS, called a fuzzy logic assessor (FLA), monitors and assesses the performance of each FL-AKF. The FLA assigns a degree of confidence, a number on the interval [0, 1], to each of the FL-AKF outputs. Finally, a defuzzification scheme obtains the fused state-vector estimate based on confidence values. The effectiveness and accuracy of this approach is demonstrated using a simulated example. Two defuzzification methods are explored and compared, and results show good performance of the proposed approach.},

A linearizing control plus a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller is suggested for PV voltage regulation at the maximum power point (MPP). In this study, the SOCSF are modeled by using an additive fault representation and the fault identification (FI) system is synthesized departing from a Luenberger observer. Hence, an FI signal is obtained, which is insensitive to irradiance and load current changes, but affected by the SOCSF. For FI purposes, only the sensors used in the control system are needed. Finally, an experimental evaluation is presented by using a solar array simulator dc power supply and a boost dc/dc converter of 175    W    in order to validate the ideas this study exposes.},

The residuals are synthesised using a model-based strategy by applying a differential geometry perspective. According to the dynamic structure of the systems considered in this work, it is deduced that the observability co-distribution built for this class of systems can be independent of the state (constant) under certain conditions, so that the resulting coordinates transformations in the state and output spaces are linear mappings. Consequently, the dynamic structure of the resulting subsystems is not altered after the coordinates transformation, and departing from these subsystems, dedicated observers can be designed for residual generation. One important property of the analysis presented in the paper is that the studied dynamical structure can be fitted to several electrical motors. Hence simulation results are illustrated for a three-phase induction motor drive application that verify the ideas presented in this work.},

  abstract = {Open- and short-circuit faults (OSCFs) in boost dc{\textendash}dc converters for photovoltaic (PV) maximum power point trackers (MPPTs) imply an inefficiency after fault is triggered, which affect the security and profitability of PV projects. Hence, fault detection and isolation (FDI) techniques have become an important issue for PV technology. In this study, a model-based FDI technique is proposed to boost dc{\textendash}dc converters in PV MPPT systems. As is well-known, major issues of model-based FDI techniques have always been parametric uncertainty and no-modelled dynamics. This study focuses on how to mitigate these shortcomings by applying a high-gain observer (HGO) as a residual generator. A striking feature of HGO's is that exponential stability is still guaranteed for bounded disturbances (or faults). As demonstrated in this study, under an integral control action in the closed-loop control system, OSCFs are characterised for ever-growing signals, enabling the suggested FDI scheme. Also, the FDI proposal is decoupled from PV current (irradiance changes) and load variations, thereby avoiding false alarms. Moreover, the output-injection gain and thresholds are selected such that the fault diagnosis is achieved in eight switching cycles, enabling a fast and reliable diagnosis. Experimental results are illustrated to validate the FDI scheme proposed in this study},

However, due to their complexity and exposure to several stresses, they are prone to suffer critical failures. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel diagnostic algorithm that allows the real-time detection and localization of multiple power switch open-circuit faults in inverter-fed ac motor drives. The proposed method is quite simple and just requires the measured motor phase currents and their corresponding reference signals, already available from the main control system, therefore avoiding the use of additional sensors and hardware. Several experimental results using a vector-controlled permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive are presented, showing the diagnostic algorithm effectiveness, its relatively fast detection time, and its robustness against false alarms.},

  abstract = {Discussions about the optimal technology of propulsion systems for future ground vehicles have been raising over the last few years. Several options include different types of technologies. However, those who are advocating conventional internal combustion engines are faced with the fact that fossil fuels are limited. Others favor hydrogen fuel as the solution for the future, either in combination with combustion engines or as an energy carrier for fuel cells. In any case, the production and storage of hydrogen is an ongoing challenge of numerous research works. Finally, there are battery-electric or hybrid propulsion systems in use, gaining more and more popularity worldwide.Ongoing advances in power electronics help to improve control systems within automotive applications. New developed or designed components enable more efficient system architectures and control. This paper includes a detailed comparison of different electric drive technologies, e.g. a DC motor, an asynchronous and synchronous motor in battery-electric or hybrid drivetrain configurations. Parameters for future drive architectures, such as high torque and power output, high system efficiency, low mass, low energy consumption, very low exhaust gas emissions, and low costs are introduced and discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of different drivetrain configurations are specified, evaluated, and discussed. Additionally, a selection of advances in power electronics is listed and described in detail. Practical examples of electric drive systems are given explicitly and conclusions for future development are made. The publication closes with an overview of current components in use and presents an outlook to future trends.},

  abstract = {This article considers the distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control problem for heterogeneous linear multiagent systems with actuator faults and nonuniform time-varying communication delays. First, novel distributed switching observers are proposed to estimate the system matrix and the state of the exosystem. The observers allow each agent to share its information with its underlying neighbors only at sampled instants of time, thus making a distinct difference from the existing results that require the exosystem matrix to be accessible to all agents at every continuous instant of time. Second, a sufficient condition is derived such that the observer error systems are exponentially stable under the influence of communication delays among interacting agents. Third, new distributed adaptive fault-tolerant controllers, which promise fewer adaptive parameters, are presented to compensate for the actuator faults. It is shown that the developed controllers are capable to effectively and efficiently solve the cooperative fault-tolerant output regulation problem with reduced computational complexity. Finally, three illustrative examples, including an inverted pendulum system, an electronic double-integrator circuit system, and an AC microgrid system, are presented to show the validity and efficiency of the developed method.},

These systems are designed to aid the driver by preventing unstable or unpredictable vehicle behavior and to stabilize the horizontal and vertical motion of the vehicle. This is achieved by the integration of actuators, sensors and data processing. However, the attained benefits are paralleled by an increase in the complexity of the system requiring enhanced methods for fault detection and diagnosis.

  abstract = {A novel fault diagnostics and prediction scheme in continuous-time is introduced for a class of nonlinear systems. The proposed method uses a novel neural network (NN) based robust integral sign of the error (RISE) observer, or estimator, allowing for semi-global asymptotic stability in the presence of NN approximation errors, disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. This is in comparison to typical results presented in the literature that show only boundedness in the presence of uncertainties. The output of the observer/estimator is compared with that of the nonlinear system and a residual is used for declaring the presence of a fault when the residual exceeds a user defined threshold. The NN weights are tuned online with no offline tuning phase. The output of the RISE observer is utilized for diagnostics. Additionally, a method for time-to-failure (TTF) prediction, a first step in prognostics, is developed by projecting the developed parameter-update law under the assumption that the nonlinear system satisfies a linear-in-the-parameters (LIP) assumption. The TTF method uses known critical values of a system to predict when an estimated parameter will reach a known failure threshold. The performance of the NN/RISE observer system is evaluated on a nonlinear system and a simply supported beam finite element analysis (FEA) simulation based on laboratory experiments. Results show that the proposed method provides as much as 25\% increased accuracy while the TTF scheme renders a more accurate prediction.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the design and validation of an active fault-tolerant control system to detect, isolate and accommodate a single thruster fault affecting the thruster-based propulsion system of an autonomous spacecraft. The proposed method consists of a fault detector for robust and quick fault detection, a two-stage hierarchical isolation strategy for fault isolation, and an online control allocation unit scheduled by the isolation scheme for fault tolerance. A new factorization approach for the uncertain inertia matrix inverse is proposed. Thanks to this factorization, a novel robust Nonlinear Unknown Input Observers (NUIO) approach is proposed based on LMIs which ensure maximization of the admissible Lipschitz constant while at the same time satisfying an L 2 gain bound and some constraints on the observer dynamics. At the first stage of the isolation scheme, a bank of NUIOs is used to identify a subset of possible faulty thrusters. Then, at the second stage, an EKF is introduced to estimate the torque bias directions. Using these directions, jointly with the detector׳s residual and the information obtained from the first stage, a set of explicit rules is derived to unambiguously isolate the faulty thruster. A Monte Carlo campaign, based on a simulator developed by Thales Alenia Space industries, is conducted in the context of a terminal rendezvous phase of the Mars Sample Return mission. Mission oriented criteria demonstrate that the proposed strategy is able to cope with a large class of realistic thruster faults and to achieve mission success.},

  abstract = {Interior permanent-magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) become attractive candidates in modern hybrid electric vehicles and industrial applications. Usually, to obtain good control performance, the electric drives of this kind of motor require one position, one dc link, and at least two current sensors. Failure of any of these sensors might lead to degraded system performance or even instability. As such, sensor fault resilient control becomes a very important issue in modern drive systems. This paper proposes a novel sensor fault detection and isolation algorithm based on an extended Kalman filter. It is robust to system random noise and efficient in real-time implementation. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is compact and can detect and isolate all the sensor faults for IPMSM drives. Thorough theoretical analysis is provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven by extensive experimental results.},

This and other developments will prompt utilities to undergo the largest changes in their history. Smart Power examines the many facets of this unprecedented transformation. This enlightening book begins with a look back on the deregulatory efforts of the 1990s and their gradual replacement by concerns over climate change, promoting new technologies, and developing stable prices and supplies. In thorough but non-technical terms it explains the revolutionary changes that the Smart Grid is bringing to utility operations. It also examines the options for low-carbon emissions along with the real-world challenges the industry and its regulators must face as the industry retools and finances its new sources and systems. Throughout the book, Peter Fox-Penner provides insights into the policy choices and regulatory reform needed to face these challenges. He not only weighs the costs and benefits of every option, but presents interviews with informed experts, including economists, utility CEOs, and engineers. He gives a brief history of the development of the current utility business model and examines possible new business models that are focused on energy efficiency.Smart Power explains every aspect of the coming energy revolution for utilities in lively prose that will captivate even the most techno-phobic readers.},

Thus we will design a nonlinear model based adaptive observer method, for detection, isolation and identification of actuator and sensor multiple and simultaneous faults. These approaches use the system model and the outputs of the adaptive observers to generate residuals. Residuals are defined in such way to isolate the faulty instrument after detecting the fault. The validity of the method will be tested in simulation of a nonlinear waste water treatment process.},

Among these methods are the generalized observer scheme, the robust parity space check, the unknown input and H {$\infty$} observer scheme, the decorrelation filter, and the concept of adaptive threshold selection. It is pointed out that the unknown input observer concept, which provides perfect decoupling from the modelling errors or its optimal approximation with the aid of H {$\infty$} techniques, constitutes a general framework of robust residual generation that generalizes and unifies numerous other approaches, among them the parity space and detection filter approach. It is further shown that this FDI method can even be applied to a certain class of nonlinear systems.},

Of special interest is the question of complexity. This depends basically on the given situation such as the kind of plant, the kind and number of faults to be detected, the demands for fault isolation, robustness and the measurements available. However, in contrast to the wide-spread opinion that models for FDI have always to be more complex than those for control, the paper shows that diagnostic models for controllable and observable plants comprise only a partial description of the input/output model and are therefore less complex than those for control. This issue is discussed in terms of different model-based FDI approaches {\textemdash} analytical, data- and knowledge-based. As for the analytical approaches the necessary order of the diagnostic model is that of the transfer operator from the fault vector to the system output.},

In this paper, a fault-tolerant converter with the ability to handle power switch open-circuit faults is addressed. The main concern of proposed converter topology is the minimization of the hardware requirements, leading to a low increase of the system cost. Firstly, the employed fault diagnostic technique does not require additional measurements, nor high computational effort. Secondly, the circuit topology reconfiguration implies a minimum number of extra components as well as minimal oversizing of the standard ones. Accordingly, a four-switch three-phase converter with the dc bus midpoint connected to the transformer neutral point and a three-switch three-phase rectifier are adopted for post-fault operation of the grid- and PMSG-side converters, respectively. Vector control strategies are proposed for both converters under analysis, focusing the issues of capacitor voltages balancing and torque ripple minimization. The performance of the proposed fault-tolerant PMSG drive is analyzed by means of experimental results.},

Recently, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) drives have achieved prominence in wind energy conversion systems (WECS), due to their reliability and availability. Therefore, in this paper a new approach is proposed for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for WECS. As opposed to the conventional state observer-based methods for current sensor faults, which require a system model and the respective parameters, the proposed diagnostic method uses the measured phase currents only. Thus, its main merits are simplicity and reliability in the diagnosis, making it suitable for real-time implementation and to trigger remedial procedures. Additionally, current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished and the affected phase is effectively identified in both cases. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to the two power converters of a conventional back-to-back topology, and its performance is analyzed by means of several experimental results.},

  abstract = {Fault diagnosis is a mandatory feature in fault-tolerant systems, since it provides the information necessary for the fault isolation and system reconfiguration. Recently, permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) drives have achieved prominence in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), due to their reliability and availability. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for current sensor fault diagnosis in PMSG drives for WECSs. As opposed to the conventional state-observer-based methods for current sensor faults, which require a system model and the respective parameters, the proposed diagnostic method uses the measured phase currents only. Thus, its main merits are simplicity and reliability in the diagnosis, making it suitable for real-time implementation and to trigger remedial procedures. In addition, current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished, and the affected phase is effectively identified in both cases. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to the two power converters of a conventional back-to-back topology, and its performance is analyzed by means of several experimental results.},

That is, the two-phase current of PMSM is sampled by pure resistance, and the phase current analog signal is analog-digital converted by TI's AMC1204. The phase current is analog filtering and digital filtering to improve the sampling effect of the phase current. Finally, the experimental results show that the designed servo driver current loop bandwidth frequency reaches 1.8kHz, which is much higher than the Hall current sensor scheme (current loop bandwidth frequency is 1.2kHz), which greatly improves the dynamic performance of the servo system.},

The innovation relies on active power estimation, together with the use of a piecewise-continuous nonlinear function, in order to eliminate the need for costly cascaded low-pass filters usually employed to estimate the reactive power. Moreover, the whole scheme is derived in the time domain on a state-space approach. As a consequence, models that are lower order and more amenable to nonlinear analysis are obtained. Simulated results for two UPS parallel operation connected to a resistive load are presented. The results indicate that the novel technique leads to a proper load sharing.},

With multi-drive systems the motor controllers must additionally be configured to provide an electronic differential effect i.e. they must also perform a similar function as their mechanical differential counterpart. Thus the electronic differential must take account of the speed difference between the two wheels when cornering. This paper presents a design for an electronic differential utilising a sliding mode controller employing a 4-switch 3-phase inverter. This type of inverter is particularly suitable for this application as the supply batteries can be easily split into two separate battery strings. The system is evaluated on a test vehicle in which the rear wheels are directly driven by permanent magnet brushless motors. Results indicate that this arrangement can be successfully implemented into an electric vehicle drive train.},

Thus, the concept of the reliability and safety of EV's components is considered a significant issue. In general, reliability and safety assessment of important electrical components of EVs, i.e. i) the battery pack, ii) power electronic converters, and iii) the electric motor, plays a significant role in the lifetime performance of EVs' electrical system. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the reliability of EVs' components from different points of view. Also, the challenges and future perspective of EVs relating to the reliability and safety, which need to be considered have been investigated.},

  abstract = {Uninterrupted and trouble-free operation of induction motors (IMs) is the compulsion of the modern industries. Firstly, the paper reviews the conventional time and spectrum signal analyses of two most effective type of signals, i.e. the vibration and the current for various IM faults. The vibration and the current signal analyses (time and spectral) is performed using the signals measured from different faulty IMs from a laboratory setup. Subsequently, the advantages and difficulties associated with these conventional procedures are discussed. Next, this paper presents and summarizes the existing research and development in the field of signal based automation of condition monitoring methodologies for the fault detection and diagnosis of various electrical and mechanical faults of IMs. Nowadays, artificial intelligent (AI) methods are being employed for the IM and other machine fault diagnosis. Advancements of the AI based fault diagnosis including the popular approaches are reviewed in details. These techniques are being integrated with traditional monitoring techniques. The AI based fault monitoring and detection techniques for IMs published up to 2000 are briefly described, however, more attention is paid to the techniques that are introduced in roughly past two decades, i.e. during 2000{\textendash}2019. In overall, this paper includes review of system signals, conventional and advance signal processing techniques; however, it mainly covers, the selection of effective statistical features, AI methods, and associated training and testing strategies for fault diagnostics of IMs. Finally, dedicated discussions on the recent developments, research gaps and future scopes in the fault monitoring and diagnosis of IMs are added.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of power electronics technology, microgrid (MG) concept has been widely accepted in the field of electrical engineering. Due to the advantages of direct current (DC) distribution systems such as reduced losses and easy integration with energy storage resources, DC MGs have drawn increasing attentions nowadays. With the increase of distributed generation, a DC MG consisting of multiple sources is a hot research topic. The challenge in such a multi-source DC MG is to provide voltage support and good power sharing performance. As the control strategy plays an important role in ensuring MG's power quality and efficiency, a comprehensive review of the state-of-art control approaches in DC MGs is necessary. This paper provides an overview of the primary and secondary control methods under the hierarchical control architecture for DC MGs. Specifically, inner loop and droop control approaches in primary control are reviewed. Centralized, distributed, and decentralized approach based secondary control is discussed in details. Key findings and future trends are also presented at last.},

Design schemes for both pure integral observers and proportional integral observers are investigated. Measurement noise and input disturbances are also simultaneously taken into account in the design. A systematic design procedure for a causal or normal multiple-integral observer is addressed, which can be implemented conveniently using Matlab software. The considered disturbance may be unbounded, which means that the presented design approach is suitable for more general cases. Moreover, the system state, together with the disturbance vector and its finite time derivatives can be simultaneously estimated. The proposed design has great potential for application to control problems, such as those in diagnosis or observer-based control. In addition, it also has good estimation robustness and can be directly applied to normal systems. Simulation results show a satisfactory tracking performance as compared to the results obtained for descriptor systems.},

Then, we summarize the optimization framework for microgrid operation, which contains the optimization objective, decision variables and constraints. Next, we systematically review the optimization algorithms for microgrid operations, of which genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms are the most commonly used. Lastly, a literature bibliometric analysis is provided; the results show that the operation optimization of microgrids has received increasing attention in recent years, and developing countries have shown more interest in this field than developed countries have.

  abstract = {Multiphase drives have the capability of continuing operating when some phases are disconnected. This feature has been traditionally achieved with a reconfiguration of the control after the open-phase fault (OPF) occurrence. Since reconfiguration requires the localization of the faulty phase, different fault detection (FD) methods that use multiple indices have been proposed. A recent study suggests, however, that it is possible to achieve a passive/natural fault tolerance with no changes at the control stage. Since reconfiguration is avoided in the passive/natural approach, the localization of the open phase(s) is no longer needed. In this context, the control just requires the FD in order to apply the corresponding derating. In this article, we suggest a single-index FD method that, together with the natural fault-tolerant control, provides enhanced robustness with minimum complexity. Experimental results confirm the possibility of detecting the fault and distinguish between the single and multiple OPFs using just one fault index.},

  abstract = {A fault-tolerant adjustable speed drive (ASD) topology is introduced in this paper. A conventional ASD topology is modified to address: 1) drive vulnerability to semiconductor device faults; 2) input voltage sags; 3) motor vulnerability to effects of long leads; and 4) minimization of common-mode (CM) voltage applied to the motor terminals. These objectives are attained by inclusion of an auxiliary IGBT inverter leg, three auxiliary diodes, and isolation-reconfiguration circuit. The design and operation of the proposed topology modifications are described for different modes: 1) fault mode, 2) active CM suppression mode, and 3) auxiliary sag compensation (ASC) mode. In case of fault and sag, the isolation and hardware reconfiguration are performed in a controlled manner using triacs/antiparallel thyristors. In normal operation, the auxiliary leg is controlled to actively suppress CM voltage. For inverter IGBT failures (short circuit and open circuit), the auxiliary leg is used as a redundant leg. During voltage sags, the auxiliary leg, along with auxiliary diodes, is operated as a boost converter. A current-shaping control strategy is proposed for the ASC mode. A detailed analysis of CM performance of the proposed topology is provided, and a new figure of merit, CM distortion ratio (CMDR), is introduced to compare the attenuation of CM voltage with that of a conventional ASD topology. The output filter design procedure is outlined. A design example is presented for an 80 kW ASD system, and simulation results validate the proposed auxiliary leg based fault-tolerant scheme. Experimental results from a scaled prototype rated at 1 hp are discussed in this paper.},

Most research works are limited to sensor fault detection and isolation, but only a few of them analyze the types of sensor faults, such as offset or gain, with the aim of reconfiguring the sensor in order to implement a fault tolerant system. This article is based on a fusion of model-based and data-driven techniques. First, an observer-based approach, using a Sliding Mode observer, is utilized for sensor fault reconstruction in real time. Then, once the fault is detected, a time window of sensor measurements and sensor fault reconstruction is sent to the remote maintenance center for fault evaluation. Finally, an offline processing is carried out to discriminate between gain and offset sensor faults, in order to get a maintenance decision-making to reconfigure the sensor during the next train stop. Fault classification is done by means of histograms and statistics. The technique here proposed is applied to the DC-link voltage sensor in a railway traction drive and is validated in a hardware-in-the-loop platform.},

Such strategy is composed of an observer-based approach for direct current (DC)-link voltage and catenary current sensors, a frequency analysis approach for motor current phase sensors and a hardware redundancy solution for speed sensors. None of them requires any hardware change requirement in the actual traction drive. All the fault detection and isolation approaches have been validated in a Hardware-in-the-loop platform comprising a Real Time Simulator and a commercial Traction Control Unit for a tram. In comparison to safety-critical systems in Aerospace applications, Railway applications do not need instantaneous detection, and the diagnosis is validated in a short time period for reliable decision. Combining the different approaches and existing hardware redundancy, an integral fault diagnosis solution is provided, to detect and isolate faults in all the sensors installed in the traction drive.},

Due to the influence of traction drive in the railway system availability, several research works have been focused on Fault Diagnosis for Railway traction drives. Fault diagnosis approaches have been applied to electric machines, sensors and power electronics. Furthermore, Condition-based maintenance framework seems to reduce corrective and Time-based maintenance works in Railway Systems. However, there is not any publication that summarizes all the research works carried out in Fault diagnosis and Condition-based Maintenance frameworks for Railway Traction Drives. Thus, this review presents the development of Health Assessment and Fault Diagnosis in Railway Traction Drives during the last decade.},

First, a controller is designed using a high order sliding mode twisting algorithm, to track a desired rotor velocity signal and an optimal rotor flux modulus, minimizing the power loss in copper and core. Then, a super-twisting (ST) sliding mode observer for stator current is designed and the rotor flux is calculated, by means of the equivalent control method. Two methods for the rotor velocity estimation are then proposed. The first consists of a further super-twisting sliding mode observer for rotor fluxes, with the purpose of retrieving the back-electromotive force components by means of the equivalent control method. These components are functions of the rotor velocity which, hence, can be easily determined. The second method is based on a generalization of the phase-locked loop methodology. Finally, a simple Luenberger observer is designed, filtering the rotor velocity estimate and giving also an estimate of the load torque. The performance of the motor is verified by means of numeric simulations and experimental tests, where good tracking results are obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a sensor fault tolerant control (FTC) strategy for electronically-coupled distributed energy resource (DER) units in grid-connected microgrid systems. First, a fault dependent dynamical model of the DER unit incorporating sensor faults is proposed. The FTC strategy is then developed using a sliding mode observer (SMO) which has an inherent robustness property. The rational for using a SMO is the need to detect and reconstruct any fault that may occur in output measurements of the system as a result of sensor failure. The fault signals are reconstructed by using a robust approach that encompasses uncertainties in the system, such as frequency variation. This paper also represents the cyber attack as an unknown sensor fault, and consequently the DER current sensor measurements manipulated by a data integrity attack can be detected and reconstructed. The reconstructed fault signals are then used to modify the faulty sensor measurements, which are fed to the voltage source converter (VSC) controller. This ensures accurate generation of pulse width modulation (PWM) signals and consequently accurate tracking of real and reactive power references. Different case studies are tested on a detailed nonlinear model of the DER system. The impact of faults on the DER performance and the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme are evaluated through extensive simulation studies. Experimental verification of the method is provided to further validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Current sensors are needed in conventional field-oriented control (FOC) in 3-phase induction motor (3-PIM) drives. Nevertheless, these sensors are exposed to different faults which reduce the reliability of drive systems. To solve this problem, a current sensor fault-tolerant control (FTC) for 3-PIM drives without speed measurement is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, a sensorless FOC strategy based on open-loop speed estimator is utilized for normal condition. A third-difference operator performs the task of fault detection and isolation (FDI). After FDI, a sensorless FOC strategy based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used for the faulty condition. In this paper, the EKF is used for stator currents and speed estimation during post-fault operation. Such scheme is appropriate for sensorless 3-PIM drives to increase safety and reliability of the system, in the case of current sensor fault. The proposed FTC scheme is experimented for a 1HP 3-PIM drive system through a DSP/TMS320F28335. The experimental results show that the proposed FTC system can accurately and effectively control the 3-PIM during both healthy and faulty conditions.},

  abstract = {Smart grids are evolving as the next generation power systems that transform the traditional ways of functioning of present electrical grids. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components in smart grids. An AMI comprises of systems and networks, that are responsible for collecting and analyzing data received from smart meters. In addition, AMI also manages the different applications related with power and services based on the data collected from smart meters. Thus, AMI plays a significant role in the smooth functioning of smart grids. Malicious adversaries have immense opportunities for attacking the AMI, as it is made up of systems that are highly vulnerable to such attacks. Providing security to AMI is necessary as adversaries can cause potential infrastructural damage and privacy threats in smart grid. One of the most effective and challenging topic's identified, is the key management system (KMS), for sustaining the security concerns in AMI. Therefore, KMS seeks to be a promising research area for future development of AMI. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to highlight the significance of KMS for the security point of view for AMI in smart grids. We believe that we have taken here the needed initiatives that will help understand the importance of key management in AMI security, and strengthen future research works carried out in this area. This survey highlights the key security issues of AMIs and focuses on how key management techniques can be utilized for safeguarding AMI. At first, we discuss the main features of AMIs, the deployment scenario of smart grids and identify the relationship between smart grid and AMI. Then, we explore the main features of AMI, and also introduce the security issues and challenges. We also provide a discussion on the role of key management in AMI, and point out the differences between traditional electrical systems and smart grids. We then classify and provide a review of the existing works in literature that deal with secure KMS in AMI. Finally, we summarize the possible future open research issues and challenges of KMS in AMI.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of fault detection and diagnosis of induction motor based on motor current signature analysis. Principal component analysis is used to reduce the three-phase current space to a 2-D space. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is adopted to evaluate the probability density functions of each healthy and faulty motor, which can be used as features in order to identify each fault. Kullback{\textendash}Leibler divergence is used as an index to identify the dissimilarity between two probability distributions, and it allows automatic fault identification. The aim is also to improve computational performance in order to apply online a monitoring system. KDE is improved by fast Gaussian transform and a points reduction procedure. Since these techniques achieve a remarkable computational cost reduction with respect to the standard KDE, the algorithm can be used online. Experiments are carried out using two alternate current motors: an asynchronous induction machine and a single-phase motor. The faults considered to test the developed algorithm are cracked rotor, out-of-tolerance geometry rotor, and backlash. Tests are carried out at different load and voltage levels to show the proposed method performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an energy management system (EMS) for single-phase or balanced three-phase microgrids via robust convex optimization. Along a finite planning horizon, the solution provided by the proposed microgrids EMS remains feasible under adverse conditions of random demands and renewable energy resources. The proposed model is represented as a convex mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Two operation modes are considered: grid-connected and isolated. In grid-connected mode, the proposed EMS minimizes the costs of energy imports, dispatches of distributed generation (DG) units, and the operation of the energy storage systems. In isolated mode, the proposed EMS minimizes the unsupplied demand considering consumer priorities. Global robustness of the proposed mathematical model is adjusted using a single parameter {$\zeta$}. The robustness of the solutions provided by the robust EMS are assessed using the Monte Carlo simulation method. In this case, DG units are set to operate in frequency and voltage droop control to support network fluctuations. Simulations are deployed using a microgrid with 136-nodes and several distributed energy resources. Results showed that the proposed model is suitable for the short-term microgrids energy management system. The robustness of the final solution was directly proportional to the operational costs, and it can be effectively controlled by the proposed parameter {$\zeta$} for both operation modes. When compared to stochastic approaches, the proposed formulation proved to be more flexible and less time-consuming.},

In this regard, micro-grids are adequate to face the technical challenges associated with the energy management that is necessary to compensate for the low predictability of energy generation due to the high variability of renewable sources. This work analyzes the economic feasibility of installing two micro-grids (with renewable generation), of interest for the Litoral-Centro region of Argentina. The first analyzed case consists in supply energy to an isolated sawmill. The second case is an interesting proposal for a large energy user (more than 300 kW installed power) in order to fulfill, in a profitable way, the obligation to self-generate renewable energy using a hydro-kinetic river turbine to supply a public lighting sector. HOMER Pro is used to design optimally the micro-grid and to simulate its electrical and economic performance during its useful life. The results are promising for the region in terms of the available resources of the Litoral Argentino.},

Current-based wind turbine fault detection techniques have received more and more attention in academia and industry due to their nonintrusive character and economic advantages. This paper presents a novel computationally efficient high-resolution wideband synchronous sampling algorithm for the mechanical fault detection of variable-speed direct-drive wind turbines (i.e., no gearbox) only using nonstationary generator stator current measurements. The proposed algorithm synchronously resamples the current signals such that the varying characteristic frequencies of the excitations generated by wind turbine faults in the current signals become constant values. An impulse detection algorithm is then proposed to detect the faults by identifying the excitations from the frequency spectra of the synchronously sampled stator current signals. Experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the detection of rotor eccentricity and bearing faults of a direct-drive wind turbine operating in variable-speed conditions.},

Presently, the trend has shifted to massively acquire operational data, which can be processed to extract really valuable information with the help of Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques. As a result, classical Condition Monitoring methodologies, such as model- and signal-based ones are being overcome by data-driven approaches. Therefore, the current paper provides a review of these data-driven active supervision strategies implemented in electric drives for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). Hence, first, an overview of the main FDD methods is presented. Then, some basic guidelines to implement the Machine Learning workflow on which most data-driven strategies are based, are explained. In addition, finally, the review of scientific articles related to the topic is provided, together with a discussion which tries to identify the main research gaps and opportunities.},

Most fault detection techniques inherit the three-phase approach by defining fault indices in a per-phase basis. A recent approach suggests an alternative fault detection mechanism based on vector space decomposition (VSD) variables, but the study is limited to open-phase faults (OPFs) for a six-phase drive that is regulated under field-oriented control. It is known, however, that 1) the open-switch faults (OSFs) in the converter are more likely than the OPF in the machine and 2) the drive performance in the event of an open-circuit fault is more critical when model predictive control (MPC) is used. This work extends the study of the VSD fault detection method to multiphase machines with different number of phases (five), control strategy (MPC), and type of faults (OPF and OSF). Although experimental results show that MPC misbehaves after the fault occurrence, the fast detection provided by the VSD approach allows a satisfactory transition to postfault mode of operation.},

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is used to extract the fault frequency spectrum features of the three-phase currents. Then, a feature selection method named ReliefF is introduced to select the most critical features by removing redundant and irrelevant features. In addition, as novel fast learning technology, a random vector functional link network is applied to learn the faulty knowledge from the historical dataset. Based on the well-learned model, the fault type and location of the converter can be accurately identified as long as the three-phase current signals are measured. Offline test results verify that the proposed method can identify the IGBT and sensor faults with an accuracy of 98.83\% and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning algorithms. Moreover, the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test results show that the proposed method can successfully identify the IGBT faults and current sensor faults within 22 ms. It is robust to the dc-link voltage fluctuations, model parameters, and speed or load variations. The extensibility of the proposed method is also validated based on the test results in terms of other fault modes and drive systems.},

The proposed method locks the active wheels of the vehicle as if they were operating on a common shaft. The locking algorithm is realized by processing the Hall sensor signals of the considered motors and driving them with a single set of ``averaged'' Hall signals. The proposed Sync-Lock Controller (SLC) is implemented digitally using a programmable integrated circuit microcontroller. First, the Hall signals undergo a layer of filtering to mitigate the errors due to hall sensor misalignment. Then, the locking algorithm is implemented by averaging the filtered Hall sensor signals. The proposed technique locks the motors directly through their corresponding magnetic fields and is shown to achieve better results as compared to a conventional speed control loop. The SLC prototype is implemented in the form of a standalone dongle-circuit that can be easily placed between the original Hall-sensors and the BLDC motor driver.},

  abstract = {In this research article, a global fault-tolerant control technique (GFTC) for field-oriented control of asynchronous (or induction) motor is addressed. It aims to present an FTC scheme that deals with the most common failures, which can alter the induction machine. Two classes of failures are treated here, machine failures such as stator winding fault and broken bars fault, and sensor failures such as current and speed sensors faults. Each failure has its own FTC system. To achieve a better design, a diagnosis algorithm based on sliding mode observers and current spectral analysis is set to detect and isolate such fault in a suitable time taking the right action to eliminate or offset the effect of this failure. This is done by providing a new threshold selection technique adopted in this work. Moreover, experimental results based on DSpace 1104 board are provided for the exploration of different scenarios showing the FTC scheme validity.},

  abstract = {The uptake of electric vehicles supports decarbonization and increasingly interconnects the electricity and transport system. While the integration of electric vehicles could challenge electricity grids, bidirectional power flows between vehicles and grids could support grid operations. Despite the globally increasing number of Vehicle-to-X trials, including Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-to-Customer, an in-depth understanding of trial implementations and expert experiences has largely been overlooked although they are both crucial for technological development and deployment. Based on our analysis of a global Vehicle-to-X trial database and 47 interviews with experts from industry and academia, we (i) provide an overview of the implementation status of Vehicle-to-X and analyze predominate trial configurations, i.e. combinations of characteristics, (ii) identify important technical, social and regulatory challenges for the implementation of Vehicle-to-X and assess and discuss expert evaluations of these challenges and (iii) derive implications for different actors. The most predominate trial configurations are Vehicle-to-Customer and transmission-level services provided by commercial fleets that charge at work due to current practical advantages of centralized approaches. From a technical standpoint, we find that although Vehicle-to-X can defer or even mitigate grid reinforcement at the distribution level, this potential is highly dependent on local conditions. Regarding social aspects, incentives and Vehicle-to-X operations need to be tailored to different vehicle users. Concerning regulation, it is imperative to avoid double taxation of electricity, simplify market participation for small providers, and further develop Vehicle-to-X standards. Implications for actors include the evaluation and enablement of portfolios with different flexibility assets, and stacking of services to increase revenue streams and reduce risk resulting from variations in driving patterns and charging behavior.},

The converter can be utilized between the ac bus and the dc bus in ac-dc hybrid microgrid and in other applications where three-phase bidirectional ac/dc conversion is needed. With two operating modes available, the converter possesses the fault-tolerant ability and the improved light-load efficiency. When the converter works in the high power application with all the components operating normally, the transformers operate in the symmetric mode and share the power equally. Then, the switch current stress can be reduced. The converter can also operate in dual transformer mode for light-load conditions or with some abnormal components. The Y-{$\Delta$} connected transformers provide an additional step-down conversion ratio and make the converter suitable for buck conversion. Furthermore, to guarantee the voltage-second balance of the transformers, the corresponding space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) algorithm is proposed. Experimental results based on a 2.4-kW prototype are presented in detail, which verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the converter's performance well.},

In addition, the influences of other practical issues, such as iron saturation, stator and rotor resistances and so on, are investigated. A per-unit model is employed for the investigation, while during the analysis, the inductance ratio between the leakage and mutual inductance is introduced. It is shown that, in general, it is very difficult to achieve infinite flux weakening performance of IMs, and only with ideal zero inductance ratio, could IM achieve infinite constant power region and the maximum utilisation of inverter. Finally, analytically calculated torque/power-speed characteristics of a 12 kW IM are verified by finite element analyses and experiments.},

This paper explores the resistive output impedance of the parallel-connected inverters in an island microgrid. The control loops are devised and analyzed, taking into account the special nature of a low-voltage microgrid, in which the line impedance is mainly resistive and the distance between the inverters makes the control intercommunication between them difficult. In contrast with the conventional droop-control method, the proposed controller uses resistive output impedance, and as a result, a different control law is obtained. The controller is implemented by using a digital signal processor board, which only uses local measurements of the unit, thus increasing the modularity, reliability, and flexibility of the distributed system. Experimental results are provided from two 6-kVA inverters connected in parallel, showing the features of the proposed wireless control},

A soft-start operation is also included, avoiding the initial current peak, which results in a seamless hot-swap operation. Active power sharing is achieved by adjusting the frequency in load transient situations only, owing to which the proposed method obtains a constant steady-state frequency and amplitude. As opposed to the conventional droop method, the transient response can be modified by acting on the main control parameters. Linear and nonlinear loads can be properly shared due to the addition of a current harmonic loop in the control strategy.

Predictive current controllers have been recently proposed for managing postfault operation of these drives when an open-phase fault is considered. However, the faulty situation assumes zero stator current while freewheeling diodes can continue conducting in a noncontrolled mode. This work analyzes the postfault operation of the five-phase drive when the freewheeling diodes of the faulty phase are still conducting. Experimental results are provided using a conventional insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)-based multiphase power converter to quantify the effect of the freewheeling diodes, when an IGBT-gating fault occurs, on the model-based predictive current-controlled drive.},

Multiphase induction motor drives are presented like a better alternative to their three-phase counterparts because of their capability to withstand faulty situations, ensuring the postfault operation of the drive. Finite-control set model-based predictive control (FCS-MPC) has been introduced in the last decade like an interesting alternative to conventional controllers for the electrical torque and current regulation of multiphase drives. However, FCS-MPC strategies for multiphase drives with the ability to manage pre- and postfault operations have not been addressed at all. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant speed control for five-phase induction motor drives with the ability to run the system before and after an open-phase fault condition using an FCS-MPC strategy. Experimental results are provided in order to validate the functionality of the proposed control method, maintaining rated currents and ensuring fast and ripple-free torque response.},

This method involves the injection of voltage signals at the carrier frequency for reconstructing the phase currents in PWM inverters using a single current sensor in the DC-link. It uses minimum signals to reduce the voltage and current harmonics caused by the injected signals. The vector of the injected voltage is at a minimum distance from the original reference to ensure the measurement time in the reconstruction of the phase currents. An injection sequence control method is also proposed to avoid an abrupt change in the injection signals. A PWM scheme for splitting phase voltages is proposed to reduce any audible noise, especially in low-speed operation. The proposed method reconstructs the phase currents with signals from a single current sensor and minimizes the amplitude of the injected signals to reduce the harmonics at audible noise frequencies in the injection signals. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Direct application of measured stator currents and using a noisy estimated speed in the prediction model degrade the steady-state performance in terms of higher current total harmonic distortion (THD), torque ripple, and flux ripple, particularly at low speeds. This paper proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based, which is a promising state observer, improved prediction model of sensorless FS-PTC for induction motor drives. The EKF has been used to estimate rotor speed, rotor/stator flux, and stator currents accurately. The estimated stator currents, instead of measured currents, are fed back to the prediction model, and thus, small stator current THD is confirmed. Depending on the commanded speed, either the rotor current model or the open-loop stator voltage model is proposed for the EKF to achieve better performance in a wide speed range, including the field-weakening region. The proposed control system has been verified experimentally, and excellent torque and flux responses, robustness, and stable operation at lower and higher speeds have been achieved.},

This paper deals then with an Electric Differential System (EDS) for an Electric Vehicle (EV) directly driven by dual induction motors in the rear wheels. A sensorless control technique is preferred to a position or speed encoder-based control one to reduce the overall cost and to improve the reliability. The EDS main feature is the robustness improvement against system uncertainties and road conditions. The EDS control performances are validated through experiments on a dSPACE-based test bench. The experimental results show that the proposed controller is able to track the speed reference and the curvature angle with good static and dynamic performances.},

Moreover, among EV's motor electric propulsion features, the energy efficiency is a basic characteristic that is influenced by vehicle dynamics and system architecture.

Such problem is difficult to resolve due to the strong interconnection between states and parameters in the nonlinear motor model, besides the unavailability of both rotor flux and load torque. In the spirit to accurately follow the on-line machine variables, this paper focuses on the simultaneous estimation of internal states and time varying parameters. Especially, a new identification scheme for rotor resistance and/or stator resistance is introduced. In the aim of decoupling the unknown electrical parameters, we adopt a mild change of coordinates that allows to easily design a two-stage of high gain observer. The simplicity of presented procedures and the efficiency for real time computation constitute both main features of the proposed approach. Moreover, possible exploitation of our algorithm in the fault detection issue is discussed through a simulation of an abrupt rotor short-circuit.},

In a constructed prototype, high-power SiC modules with dedicated drivers are utilized to achieve high-efficiency and compact size. Each module has two interconnected switches with anti-parallel diodes resembling a converter leg. It is observed that the driver halts the module operation as a result of protective actions such as overcurrent, gate undervoltage, or gate overvoltage. In this frozen leg mode, the module operates as a leg with two diodes until an external hardware signal resets the driver. The converter continues operation but with a reduced performance. Analysis, simulation, and verification of a three-phase DAB converter under a frozen leg operation are considered in this paper. The converter with a frozen leg has two different behaviors at light loads and heavy loads. Consequently, two different analysis methods are developed to solve converter operation in different load conditions. Results show that the power transfer capability is reduced, but this fault mode is nondestructive.},

However, the validity would be affected because of planar bus bar and capacitor. A DC-link current sensor measures the sum of capacitor current and phase current. In this paper, a mathematical model is built and the parameters are recognized when the system is running. If the phase current sensor failure occurs, the state observer will be used to calculate the phase current.},

  abstract = {The deepening impact of global warming has stimulated numerous researchers to come up with alternative energy sources and transportation facilities that create fewer emissions. DC distribution systems are attractive candidates for adapting high penetration of distributed generation and electric vehicles. Accordingly, this work proposes a distributed power management scheme to enhance the reliability and economic performance of isolated dc microgrids. In the presented approach, the dc microgrid is assumed to contain both renewable and nonrenewable generating units. At lower loading conditions, the proposed scheme stimulates a power-sharing strategy among renewable sources to increase system reliability, whereas nonrenewable sources are kept operating at their lower power limits. Alternatively, renewable sources are allowed to operate at their maximum power limits while maintaining optimum economic operation among nonrenewable sources to meet higher loading conditions. To achieve these operational criteria, both renewable and nonrenewable DG units apply a consensus-based algorithm in a supervisory control level. Each DG unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thereby locally updating the no-load voltage setting of its primary control according to system voltage sensitivity analysis. The incorporation of DG droop-based primary control renders the proposed algorithms fully distributed with a reduced number of agents. The proposed algorithm has the additional advantage of restoring system voltage to its nominal value. The stability and convergence of the algorithm are analytically addressed, and real-time OPAL-RT simulations are performed in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application to verify its effectiveness.},

Two power management aspects are considered: 1) equal power sharing, which is realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing algorithm; and 2) optimal power dispatch, which is achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. The proposed algorithms are based on the application of the average consensus theory along with voltage sensitivity analysis. Each distributed generation (DG) unit exchanges information with its neighbors, thus locally updating its no-load voltage setting to achieve the supervisory control objectives.

  abstract = {The increasing integration of the distributed renewable energy sources highlights the requirement to design various control strategies for microgrids (MGs) and microgrid clusters (MGCs). The multiagent system (MAS)-based distributed coordinated control strategies show the benefits to balance the power and energy, stabilize voltage and frequency, achieve economic and coordinated operation among the MGs and MGCs. However, the complex and diverse combinations of distributed generations (DGs) in MAS increase the complexity of system control and operation. In order to design the optimized configuration and control strategy using MAS, the topology models and mathematic models such as the graph topology model, noncooperative game model, the genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm are summarized. The merits and drawbacks of these control methods are compared. Moreover, since the consensus is a vital problem in the complex dynamical systems, the distributed MAS-based consensus protocols are systematically reviewed. On the other hand, the communication delay issue, which is inevitable no matter in the lowor high-bandwidth communication networks, is crucial to maintain the stability of the MGs and MGCs with fixed and random delays. Various control strategies to compensate the effect of communication delays have been reviewed, such as the neural network-based predictive control, the weighted average predictive control, the gain scheduling scheme, and synchronization schemes based on the multitimer model for the case of fixed communication delay, and the generalized predictive control, networked predictive control, model predictive control, Smith predictor, H{$\infty$}-based control, sliding mode control for the random communication delay scenarios. Furthermore, various control methods have been summarized to describe switching topologies in MAS with different objectives, such as the plug-in or plug-out of DGs in an MG, and the plug-in or plug-out of MGs in an MGC, and multiagentbased energy coordination and the economic dispatch of the MGC. Finally, the future research directions of the multiagent-based distributed coordinated control and optimization in MGs and MGCs are also presented.},

  abstract = {Induction motor (IM) drives, specifically the three-phase IMs, are a nonlinear system that are difficult to explain theoretically because of their sudden changes in load or speed conditions. Thus, an advanced controller is needed to enhance IM performance. Among numerous control techniques, fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has increasing popularity in designing complex IM control system due to their simplicity and adaptability. However, the performance of FLCs depends on rules and membership functions (MFs), which are determined by a trial-and-error procedure. The main objective of this paper is to present a critical review on the control and optimization techniques for solving the problems and enhancing the performance of IM drives. A detailed study on the control of variable speed drive, such as scalar and vector, is investigated. The scalar control functions of speed and V/f control are explained in an open- and closed-loop IM drive. The operation, advantages, and limitations of the direct and indirect field-oriented controls of vector control are also demonstrated in controlling the IM drive. A comprehensive review of the different types of optimization techniques for IM drive applications is highlighted. The rigorous review indicates that existing optimization algorithms in conventional controller and FLC can be used for IM drive. However, some problems still exist in achieving the best MF and suitable parameters for IM drive control. The objective of this review also highlights several factors, challenges, and problems of the conventional controller and FLC of the IM drive. Accordingly, the review provides some suggestions on the optimized control for the research and development of future IM drives. All the highlighted insights and recommendations of this review will hopefully lead to increasing efforts toward the development of advanced IM drive controllers for future applications.},

Three commonly occurring instability phenomena and their remedies are discussed, along with suitable analysis methods. Low-speed instabilities are most severe, and therefore, the stator resistance is the single most critical parameter. Methods for reducing the impact of this parameter are discussed.},

The method uses stator current derivative measurements made in response to certain PWM vectors. In this work the derivatives are created from measurements made with standard hall-effect sensors (at the start and end of switching vectors), meaning that specialist transducers, such as Rogowski Coils, are not required. However, under narrow PWM vectors high frequency (HF) oscillations can disrupt the current and current derivative responses. In previous work, the time that PWM vectors were applied to the machine for was extended to a threshold known as the minimum pulse width (tmin) in order to allow the HF oscillations to decay and a derivative measurement to be obtained. This introduces additional distortion to the motor current. It is shown here that an artificial neural network can be used to estimate derivatives using measurements from a standard current sensor before the HF oscillations have fully decayed, thus permitting a reduction of the minimum pulse width (and associated distortion).},

  abstract = {Dynamically accurate torque control is an essential prerequisite for higher performance motor drive systems. For ac induction motors (IMs), the two most established strategies are direct torque control (DTC) and vector or field orientated control. DTC directly switches the inverter to regulate torque without requiring explicit stator current regulation. However, it suffers from variable switching frequency and is more challenging to implement in digital controllers. Vector control separately regulates the ``torque'' and ``flux'' producing components of the motor stator current and is readily suited to a digital implementation with a constant switching frequency. However, it requires accurate current control to be effective, typically achieved using a linear current regulation system. The principles of linear current regulation are well established and have been researched intensively over many years. However, their quantitative design is still an uncertain mix of theory and practice, including in particular how to best set the regulator gains. This paper addresses this issue, by presenting a precisely matched comparative analysis of three alternative PI, and a hysteresis-based, current regulation strategies, suitable for use in a ``standard'' vector control IM drive. The results show that properly tuned, all four strategies have essentially the same performance, suggesting that the choice between them needs really only be made on the basis of convenience of implementation and/or cost.},

  abstract = {Current regulation plays an important role in modern power electronic AC conversion systems. The most direct strategy to regulate such currents is to use a simple closed loop proportional-integral (PI) regulator, which has no theoretical stability limits as the proportional and integral gains are increased, since it is only a second order system. However, pulsewidth modulation (PWM) transport and controller sampling delays limit the gain values that can be achieved in practical systems. Taking these limitations into account, this paper presents an analytical method to determine the best possible gains that can be achieved for any class of practical linear AC current controller. The analysis shows that the maximum possible proportional gain is determined by the plant series inductance, the DC bus voltage and the transport and sampling delays, while the maximum possible integral gain is determined primarily by the transport and sampling delays. The work is applicable to stationary frame PI regulators, stationary frame controllers with back electromotive force compensation, stationary frame P+ resonant (PR) controllers, and synchronous \emph{d}- \emph{q} frame controllers, since they all have identical proportional and integral gains that must be optimized for any particular application.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new sensorless vector control method for permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) which employs discrete-time high-frequency voltage injection. The frequency range of the injected voltage is almost the same as that of the PWM carrier used in inverters. This allows highspeed phase estimation and high-performance drive, with possibly low acoustic noise caused by the injected voltage. The current associated with the injected voltage, which also has a frequency almost equal to the carrier frequency, must be analyzed in a discrete-time manner. This is because, in the range of the carrier frequency, a simple approximation of the continuous-time analysis of the high-frequency current cannot be applied. Based on discrete-time analysis, this paper reconstructs the conventional rotor phase estimation methods using high-frequency current correlation signals. The usefulness of the proposed method is verified through extensive experiments.},

In the hybrid micro-grid, dc sources, energy storage, and loads are connected to a main dc bus, while the ac sources and sinks are coupled with a main ac bus. A bidirectional converter/inverter exchanges power between both sides. Such structure should be supervised by a main controller or management system. In this approach, the power flow is supervised based on solving an optimization problem, while the maximum available powers for fault-free and erroneous wind, solar, and energy storage sub-systems are taken into account. It is shown that solar and wind sub-system failures affect maximum available powers from those resources. In order to satisfy the demanded power with maximum utilization of renewable resources, the tolerance of the proposed supervisory controller (SC) toward shading and converter faults in the solar system, and lubricant system failure and converter fault in the wind system is considered in the design procedure. Moreover, the tolerance of the proposed power management system toward energy storage failure in each micro-grid is also incorporated in the overall control scheme. Effectiveness of the proposed SC is evaluated through extensive simulation runs based on dynamical models of the power resources.},

This necessitates a supervisory control system to split power between its different resources, which has sparked attention on the development of power management systems (PMSs). In this paper, a robust optimal PMS (ROPMS) is developed for a hybrid ac/dc micro-grid, where the power flow in the micro-grid is supervised based on solving an optimization problem. Satisfying demanded power with maximum utilization of renewable resources, minimum usage of fuel-based generator, extending batteries lifetime, and limited utilization of the main power converter between the ac and dc micro-grids are important factors that are considered in this approach. Uncertainties in the resources output power and generation forecast errors, along with static and dynamic constraints of the resources, are taken into account. Furthermore, since uncertainties in the resources output power may result in fluctuations in the dc bus voltage, a two-level controller is used to regulate charge/discharge power of the battery banks. Effectiveness of the proposed supervisory system is evaluated through extensive simulation runs based on dynamical models of the power resources.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a distributed hierarchical control is proposed for ac microgrid, which could apply to both grid-connected (GC) mode and islanded (IS) mode as well as mode transitions. The control includes three control levels: 1) the basic droop control is adopted as the primary control; 2) the secondary control is based on the distributed control with a leader{\^a}{\u A}"follower consensus protocol; and 3) the tertiary level is a mode-supervisory control, which manages the different control targets of four operation modes. Under the proposed control framework, the following targets are achieved: 1) the frequency/voltage recovery and accurate power sharing in IS mode; 2) flexible power flow regulation between utility-grid and microgrid in GC mode; 3) universal control strategy from GC to IS modes without control switching; and 4) smooth active-synchronization from IS mode to GC mode. In this sense, the proposed method can adapt to all four operation modes of microgrid. Compared with central-standard hierarchical control, the proposed method only requires local neighbor-to-neighbor interaction with a sparse distributed communication network. Thus, the scalability, flexibility, reliability, and robustness are greatly improved in practical application. In addition, stability analysis is added to facilitate the control parameter designs, and substantial simulation cases are provided to validate the control feasibility, link-failure-resiliency, and plug-and-play capability.},

  abstract = {Air pollution and climate warming become more and more intensified in many areas, especially in urban areas. Environmental parameters are critical information to air pollution and weather monitoring. Thus, it is necessary to develop a suitable air pollution and weather monitoring system for urban areas. In this study, a vehicle monitoring system (VMS) based on the IoT technique is developed. Cars are selected as the research tool because it can reach a greater number of streets to collect data. The VMS can monitor different environmental parameters, including ambient temperature and humidity, and air quality parameters, including PM2.5, NO2, CO, and O3. The VMS can provide other information, including GPS signals and the vibration information through driving a car on the street. Different sensor modules are used to measure the parameters and collect the measured data and transmit them to a cloud server through the LoRa protocol. A user interface is used to show the sensing data storing at the cloud server. To examine the performance of the system, a researcher drove a Nissan x-trail 1998 to the area close to the Da'an District office in Taipei to collect monitoring data. The collected data are instantly shown on the user interface. The four kinds of information are provided by the interface: GPS positions, weather parameters, vehicle information, and air quality information. With the VMS, users can obtain the information regarding air quality and weather conditions when they drive their car to an urban area. Also, government agencies can make decisions on traffic planning based on the information provided by the proposed VMS.},

By learning from the changes in the riding environment, the proposed RLAPM adaptively dispatches appropriate assisted motor power to support the rider in meeting the QoR requirement, i.e., safety and comfort, of the pedelec. With the RLAPM, not only pedelec rider's QoR is guaranteed, but energy utilization of battery is improved as well. Simulations of the RLAPM and the RLAPM enhancement (RLAPME) for the pedelec are performed under different road types. Experimental results demonstrate that the achievability of the comfort riding of the RLAPME is improved by 24\%, while the energy utilization is improved by 50\% by comparing with other existing assisted power methods for the pedelec in urban riding.},

The DAB3 converter is employed as a single-stage solution to step up dc voltage levels and perform the maximum power point tracking of the PV farm at the same time. In order to achieve a high weighted average efficiency over a wide operation range, design considerations of the stray inductance and transformer's turns ratio are presented to shape the soft-switching region of the DAB3 converter in order to match the area of the maximum power points for the PV panels in the given environmental conditions. To further maximize the energy yield of the entire PV power generation system, a novel MOPPT method is proposed to track the maximum output power point of the DAB3 converter. The MOPPT is implemented by a cascaded closed-loop voltage control with the PV current feedforward compensation to improve the dynamic performance. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by both simulations and the experimental verification of a down-scaled laboratory prototype.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) stations have been widely built in the world to utilize solar energy directly. In order to reduce the capital and operational costs, early fault diagnosis is playing an increasingly important role by enabling the long effective operation of PV arrays. This paper analyzes the terminal characteristics of faulty PV strings and arrays, and it develops a PV array fault diagnosis technique. The terminal current{\textendash}voltage curve of a faulty PV array is divided into two sections, i.e., high-voltage and low-voltage fault diagnosis sections. The corresponding working points of healthy string modules and of healthy and faulty modules in an unhealthy string are then analyzed for each section. By probing into different working points, a faulty PV module can be located. The fault information is of critical importance for the maximum power point tracking and the array dynamical reconfiguration. Furthermore, the string current sensors can be eliminated, and the number of voltage sensors can be reduced by optimizing voltage sensor locations. Typical fault scenarios including monostring, multistring, and a partial shadow for a 1.6-kW 3 3 PV array are presented and experimentally tested to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.},

  abstract = {Electrified vehicles are considered a promising technology for energy savings and emission reductions. Both powertrain design (configuration design and component sizing) and energy management strategies (EMSs) for electrified vehicles have been studied extensively. However, powertrain design and energy management need to be examined holistically and optimized simultaneously, from a mechatronic viewpoint, for maximizing the potential of electrified powertrains. This article provides a comprehensive, critical review of the current state, and prospects of electrified powertrain design and energy management. The research status in both powertrain design and energy management development is reviewed and discussed. First, the modeling techniques for rapid configuration design are thoroughly reviewed and summarized. Then, the optimization methods for component sizing are elucidated. Next, the classical EMSs are categorized, and several near-optimal strategies used for powertrain design are elaborated. Finally, the current challenges and future trends of electrified powertrain design and control are discussed, which provides a useful reference to researchers in this area.},

First, a sliding mode observer based on the extended flux linkage is built to simplify the motor model, which effectively eliminates the phenomenon of salient poles and the dependence on the direct axis inductance parameter, and can also be used for real-time calculation of feedback torque. Then a sliding mode current observer is constructed in {$\alpha\beta$} coordinates to generate the fault residuals of the phase current sensors. The method can accurately identify abrupt gain faults and slow-variation offset faults in real time in faulty sensors, and the generated residuals of the designed fault detection system are not affected by the unknown input, the structure of the observer, and the theoretical derivation and the stability proof process are concise and simple. The RT-LAB real-time simulation is used to build a simulation model of the hardware in the loop. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new open-circuit fault diagnosis algorithm for multiple switch of microgrid inverter in different load change condition. From the analysis of the waveform features and frequency composition for the main fault component under the different switch states, a low frequency sampling principle of the main fault component is developed. For the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm, first, based on above principle, small sampling data are obtained by the second low frequency mean sample processing, which can be used to reflect the main component features of different switch states and reduce the amount of the processed data. Because the data of the second low frequency mean sample processing comes from the obtained system data, it does not add any additional hardware and has the lower cost. Moreover, the obtained low frequency sampling data are divided into different feature data to adopt corresponding data processing scheme. Thus, the information of the main fault component is retained and the impact of load change is removed for any feature data. Furthermore, the feature values of the processed low frequency sampling data are extracted from the viewpoint of data attenuation. Finally, neural network is used to implement intelligent classification. The dependency and the number of threshold can be reduced, and low frequency sampling data are fully utilized to reflect the overall features. Compared with the existing fault diagnosis algorithms, the actual computational quantity is effectively reduced without affecting the accuracy and stability of the diagnosis results for microgrid inverter under load change condition. Finally, the effectiveness of fault diagnosis algorithm is verified through the detailed simulation and experiment results.},

Failure of a sensor could destabilize the system, which could have serious consequences to the system's operations. Therefore, there is a need to detect and accommodate such failures, particularly if the system in question is of a safety critical application. In this paper, a sensor failure detection, identification, and accommodation (SFDIA) scheme is presented. This scheme is based on the fully connected cascade (FCC) neural network (NN) architecture. The NN is trained using the neuron by neuron learning algorithm. This NN architecture is chosen because of its efficiency in terms of the number of neurons and the number of inputs required to solve a problem. The SFDIA scheme considers failures in pitch, roll, and yaw rate gyro sensors of an aircraft. A total of 105 experiments were conducted; out of which, only one went undetected. The SFDIA scheme presented here is efficient, compact, and computationally less expensive, in comparison to schemes using, for example, the popular multilayer perceptron NN. These benefits are inherited from the FCC NN architecture.},

The model-based field orientation consists of a flux observer with an adaptive speed estimator that has unstable regions at zero frequency and zero speed. Saliency-based flux orientation utilizes magnetic saliencies caused by saturation and high-frequency injection that causes the torque ripples due to the chattering. The chattering is caused by the higher cutoff frequency of the flux-angle estimation to keep its high dynamics. The proposed method compensates both faults and realizes complete speed estimation from zero to high-speed condition including zero stator frequency.},

The book gives an introduction into advanced methods of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). After definitions of important terms, the reliability, availability, safety and systems integrity of technical processes is considered. Then fault-detection methods for single signals without models like limit and trend checking and with harmonic and stochastic models, like Fourier analysis, correlation and wavelets are treated. This is followed by fault detection with process models using the relationships between signals like parameter estimation, parity equations, observers and principal component analysis. The treated fault-diagnosis methods include classification methods from Bayes classification to neural networks with decision trees and inference methods from approximate reasoning with fuzzy logic to hybrid fuzzy-neuro systems.Especially for safety-critical processes fault-tolerant systems are required. Basic redundant structures like n-out-of-m systems, cold and hot standby are considered and ways to design fault-tolerant sensors, actuators and control systems are outlined.Several practical examples for fault detection and diagnosis of DC motor drives, a centrifugal pump, automotive suspension and tire show applications.},

  abstract = {Power Conditioning Systems (PCS) based on three-level converters with series-connected 10kV SiC MOSFETs have gained popularity for medium voltage applications with the increase in distributed energy sources. With the use of Silicon Carbide (SiC), a wide bandgap semiconductor composed of Silicon (Si) and Carbon (C), MOSFET increases in power electronics application due to higher switching frequency operations. A high switching frequency such as 10 kHz or more leads to a reduction in magnetic components' size and the PCS structure's size. Therefore, the smaller, modular, and lightweight PCS can be attained for micro-grid integration, EV charging, or high inertia-dominated power grid applications. The three-level NPC (3L-NPC) inverter using series-connected 10kV SiC MOSFET is a suitable topology for coupling the PCS with the medium-voltage utility grid. The converter's pole sustainability increases with the two series-connected switches, yet the switches are still sensitive and prone to malfunction under various environmental and mechanical causes. Therefore, a meticulous fault isolation and coordination design may be necessary for the front-end converter for possible switch faults in the converter poles. A well-designed fault-tolerant controller may sustain the converter operation under fault conditions while protecting the healthy parts of the converter. Besides, it minimizes the harmful effects of fault on the grid side and increases the system availability. This paper analyzes short and open circuit switch faults that might occur in the PCS. Accordingly, a fault-tolerant method and a fault isolation method are proposed. The proposed methods are verified with Saber{\texttrademark} and the Real-Time Digital Simulator simulation platforms.},

A paralleled ac system, such as a multiinverter microgrid, is susceptible to circulating currents due to differences in voltage magnitude, frequency, phase angle, or dc offset. Circulating currents due to differences in voltage magnitude and dc offset have been known issues reported in literature. However, an in-depth analysis of the problem is required to ascertain the deviation of the system-operating condition from the desired condition. This paper provides a mathematical model that predicts the effect of voltage-magnitude offsets on reactive power sharing between inverters. Simulation and experimental results verify the accuracy of the analytical results obtained from the mathematical model. We examine the effect of dc-circulating currents and propose a simple capacitor emulation control law implemented in software to eliminate dc-circulating currents. This solution is a possible alternative for hardware implementation to eliminate dc-circulating currents. The effectiveness of the capacitor emulation control law has been verified through experimental results.},

  abstract = {This research focuses on the preferences of micro-mobility users in urban areas, specifically shared electric bikes (e-bikes), shared conventional bikes (bike), and shared electric scooters (e-scooters). It is found that previous scholars study traveler preferences of traditional transport modes while limited attention has been given to preferences of travelers toward micro-mobility considering electric scooters and bikes over conventional bikes. In order to address this gap, a discrete choice modeling approach is used to study the preferences of people through developing a transport choice model. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is designed where choice sets that combine the shared micro transport modes where three associated attributes and four levels are included in the DCE for each alternative. A stated preference (SP) survey is designed and distributed in Budapest, Hungary. This research focuses on urban areas where travel time is relatively short. Multinomial Logit (MNL) model is applied where a transport choice model is developed. The effect of several factors on the preferences of people toward the three micro transport modes are evaluated. The developed transport choice model includes trip time, trip cost, walking distance, parking characteristics, and socio-demographic factors. The results indicate that travelers prefer using bikes more than e-bikes and e-scooters. Furthermore, it is found that e-scooter is the least favored by travelers. It is noteworthy that car drivers, individuals with access to or frequent usage of micro-mobility, graduate students, full-time workers, males, and young people are more willing to use shared electric micro-mobility services. The probability of choosing a transport mode based on the changes on parking type attribute is estimated in this research. The results show that travelers prefer free floating parking when they use shared electric micro-mobility services. This research underscores the significance of parking type (docks or dockless) and socio-demographic variables when it comes to micro-mobility modes in urban areas. It is evident that shared electric micro-mobility options require more effort and policy support to be effectively implemented, as shared conventional bikes appear more appealing to users. Overall, these findings contribute to the understanding of micro-mobility preferences and highlight areas for further exploration and potential policy interventions.},

This paper reviews a wide range of motor- and controller-based design techniques that have been described in the literature for minimizing the generation of cogging and ripple torques in both sinusoidal and trapezoidal PMAC motor drives. Sinusoidal PMAC drives generally show the greatest potential for pulsating torque minimization using well-known motor design techniques such as skewing and fractional slot pitch windings. In contrast, trapezoidal PMAC drives pose more difficult trade-offs in both the motor and controller design which may require compromises in drive simplicity: and cost to improve torque smoothness. Controller-based techniques for minimizing pulsating torque typically involve the use of active cancellation algorithms which depend on either accurate tuning or adaptive control schemes for effectiveness. In the end, successful suppression of pulsating torque ultimately relies on an orchestrated systems approach to all aspects of the PMAC machine and controller design which often requires a carefully selected combination of minimization techniques},

  abstract = {The increased penetration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in different applications with critical loads such as in medical applications, industrial control systems, and telecommunications has highlighted pressing needs to address reliability and service continuity. Recently, distributed maximum power point tracking architectures, based on dc{\textendash}dc converters, are being used increasingly in PV systems. Nevertheless, dc{\textendash}dc converters are one of the important failure sources in a PV system. Since the semiconductor switches are one of the most critical elements in these converters, a fast switch fault detection method (FDM) is a mandatory step to guarantee the service continuity of these systems. This paper proposes a very fast FDM based on the shape of the inductor current associated to fault-tolerant (FT) operation for boost converter used in PV systems. By implementing fault diagnosis and reconfiguration strategies on a single field-programmable gate array target, both types of switch failure (open- and short-circuit faults) can be detected, identified and handled in real time. The FDM uses the signal provided by the current sensor dedicated to the control of the system. Consequently, no additional sensor is required. The proposed FT topology is based on a redundant switch. The results of hardware-in-the-loop and experimental tests, which all confirm the excellent performances of the proposed approach, are presented and discussed. The obtained results show that a switch fault can be detected in less than one switching period, typically around 100 ms in medium power applications, by the proposed FDM.},

In this method, two appropriate transformation matrices are applied to the equations of faulty induction machine. It is shown that the structure of the derived faulty induction machine equations is similar to the healthy 3-phase induction motor equations; make it possible to control a faulty machine with some modifications in the conventional controller. Hence, a modified rotor flux field-oriented controller that capable to control a star-connected 3-phase induction motor under open-phase fault is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments on a 1.5 kW star-connected 3-phase induction motor drive. The comparative results obtained from the simulations and experiments confirm the ability of the proposed control method in vector control of 3-phase induction motor during open-phase fault.},

  abstract = {Rotor flux observers can provide an attractive means for achieving direct field oriented control of induction machines. This paper presents a physics-based design methodology and uses it to evaluate open-loop observers and to develop a new closed-loop flux observer. It is shown that the new flux observer is a straightforward structure with properties that combine the best features of known methods. A distinction is made between observers, which use only integration and feedback summation operations, and those estimation methods requiring approximate differentiation which are, in essence, "cancellation" methods. Furthermore, a clear distinction is made between accuracy and dynamic robustness of the observer. This distinction is important because the accuracy of flux observers for induction machines is inherently parameter sensitive, whereas robustness of observers, in a controls sense, is not parameter sensitive. Moreover, it is shown how flux observers can provide robust field oriented control because the flux angle is substantially more correct than the flux magnitude. A distinctive form of frequency response function (FRF) analysis similar to that used in classical control engineering is demonstrated to be a useful and insightful tool even though flux observers are multiple-input, multiple-output systems. Finally, the limits of such flux observers are experimentally evaluated.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {This paper develops a transient monitoring function (TMF) based fault detection method for DC microgrids (DCMGs). In this method, the measured currents from one-end of the poles are firstly transformed into modal components. Then, the modal current is estimated using TMF concept. Afterward, the residual signal is defined as the absolute value of the difference between the modal and estimated currents. This signal has negligible fluctuations during the normal operation, while it experiences significant variations after fault occurrence. This feature is selected to reflect the fault incidence. To do so, the teager-kaiser energy operator (TKEO) is applied to the residual signal to amplify the changes, followed by a fault detection index (FDI). Comparing FDI with a threshold can reveal the fault. Furthermore, FDI can discriminate the faulty conditions in different operation modes of DCMG with a wide variation of fault conditions. To assess the developed scheme performance, a DCMG with different kinds of sources and loads is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The results confirm the quickness and the high accuracy of the proposed technique. Moreover, the method is validated in an experimental laboratory small-scale test bench. Finally, to demonstrate the superiority of the method, a comparative study with recent methods is presented.},

  abstract = {Throughout the world there is concern over the impact of energy use on the environment (particularly CO2 emissions) and also over the security of fossil fuel supplies. Consequently, governments and energy planners are actively encouraging alternative and cleaner forms of energy production such as renewables (e.g. wind, solar, biomass) and combined heat and power (CHP). The economics and locations of sustainable energy sources have meant that many of these new generators are connected into distribution networks. It is recognized that the information flow and control of distribution networks is inadequate for these future low-carbon electricity supply systems. The future distribution network will change its operation from passive to active, and the distributed generators will be controlled to support the operation of the power system. In many countries this transformation of electricity supply is managed through energy markets and privately owned, regulated transmission and distribution systems. This book discusses the connection of generation to distribution networks and then moves on to consider how sustainable generation can be fully integrated into the operation of the power system. Both technical and economic aspects are addressed. It is written for later-year undergraduate and postgraduate students studying courses on energy. The book has four tutorial chapters (with examples and questions) to provide fundamental material for those without a strong electrical engineering background.},

  abstract = {For measuring the phase currents in two-phase motor drives driven by a three-leg inverter, the leg shunt sensing method using the shunt resistors inserted below the lower switches of the inverter can be used for cost saving. In this case, the three-leg shunt sensing method using the three-shunt resistors of the inverter can widen the measurable current areas more than the two-leg shunt sensing method only using the two-shunt resistors on its two-phase legs since it can reconstruct the immeasurable currents in the two-leg shunt method. However, under high voltage modulation conditions, there are the certain operation areas where the currents cannot be accurately reconstructed using this three-leg shunt sensing method. Due to those areas, the voltage utilization of the inverter is reduced, and the torque ripple and noise of the AC motors are induced. In this paper, we analyzed the current reconstruction areas in the three-leg shunt sensing method of the three-leg two-phase inverter with a CPWM (Continuous Pulse Width Modulation), and proposed a scheme to expand the areas. The proposed scheme can expand those by decreasing the areas in which the currents cannot be reconstructed by half utilizing a DPWM (Discontinuous PWM) method, resulting in improved the voltage utilization of the inverter.},

IGBTs' thermal impedance and the junction temperature can be used as health indicators for through-life condition monitoring (CM) where the terminal characteristics are measured and the devices' internal temperature-sensitive parameters are employed as temperature sensors to estimate the junction temperature. An auxiliary power supply unit, which can be converted from the battery's 12-V dc supply, provides power to the in situ test circuits and CM data can be stored in the on-board data-logger for further offline analysis. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the developed test circuitry and also compared with finite-element thermoelectrical simulation. The test results from thermal cycling are also compared with acoustic microscope and thermal images. The developed circuitry is proved to be effective to detect solder fatigue while each IGBT in the converter can be examined sequentially during red-light stopping or services. The D\&P circuitry can utilize existing on-board hardware and be embedded in the IGBT's gate drive unit.},

This paper presents a new open-switch fault real-time diagnosis method in the VSI based on the phase currents. First, on the basis of real-time measured two phase currents, the sum of the absolute value of the normalized phase currents is calculated, whose average value is less relevant to the transient condition such as load variations and current frequency variations. Second, the current zero-cross detection method is employed to avoid the influence of current distortion caused by the transient condition. Then, the fault detection signal is built to precisely localize the faulty switches, and the real-time fast diagnosis for three-phase VSI with the open-switch fault is realized. Finally, the experiment results verify the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Under a single 'fault-type hypothesis', either actuator/component faults or sensor faults, geometric conditions are given such that the original nonlinear system can be transformed into two different subsystems with uncertainty. The first is in the generalised observer canonical form, which is not affected by faults. The second, whose states can be measured, is affected by the faults. Constructing a nonlinear observer for the first subsystem allows estimation of the faults from the second subsystem. Robust (sliding mode) observers are proposed depending on different assumptions on the system uncertainties. The decision logic associated with the proposed bank of observers, and some extensions to simultaneous actuator and sensor faults case are also discussed. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the design procedures and the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

Even though the control objectives of both approaches are the same, each method uses its own unique ways to achieve the objectives. Therefore, different approaches can lead to seemingly different results. Advantages and limitations of each method are examined through at philosophical level as well as quantitative case studies using an aircraft flight control system as a test system. A distinctive feature of this paper is that it provides an objective assessment of the two most popular fault-tolerant control system design methodologies in an unbiased and comparative setting.},

  abstract = {The bidirectional ac/dc converter is widely used to realize the power conversion between ac and dc microgrid, but the faults of switch devices and unbalanced grid voltages may lead to the decline of power quality and affect normal operation of the converter. The four-switch three-phase (FSTP) fault-tolerant structure is reconstructed from a six-switch three-phase structure with switch device fault. In order to reduce harmonic currents and output power fluctuations under unbalanced grid voltages, finite states model predictive direct power control (MPDPC) with power compensation method is proposed for FSTP structure and predictive power model of the bidirectional FSTP ac/dc converter is established. The power compensation values are expressed by grid voltages and their quadrature signals that lagging 90 electrical degrees in the {$\alpha\beta$} stationary coordinate system. Compared with the conventional method, phase-locked loop, pulse width modulation, and complex positive-/negative-sequence extraction of grid voltage are not required. Ripples of active power or reactive power under unbalanced grid voltages are eliminated. The proposed fault-tolerant MPDPC with power compensation method ensures the continuous and reliable operation of the bidirectional ac/dc converter with high power quality. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed control strategy under symmetrical unbalanced grid voltages with switch device faults.},

The number of models employed depends on the characteristics of the system, the nature of the failures considered, and the physical limits of system variables. The achievable performance under various component failures are represented in the form of reference models, known as performance reduced reference models. These models are used to synthesize a set of controllers. Under a specific fault condition, proper controller and revised control system command input are selected automatically to achieve desired performance. A simulation example of an aircraft subject to different type of failures has been used to illustrate the design process and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

The reliability of VSIs is one of the most important factors to improve the reliability and availability levels of the drive. Accordingly, this paper presents a robust fault diagnostic method for multiple insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) open-circuit faults and current sensor faults in three-phase PMSM drives. The proposed observer-based algorithm relies on an adaptive threshold for fault diagnosis. Current sensor and open-circuit faults can be distinguished and the faulty sensors and/or power semiconductors are effectively isolated. The proposed technique is robust to machine parameters and load variations. Several simulation and experimental results using a vectorcontrolled PMSM drive are presented, showing the diagnostic algorithm robustness against false alarms and its effectiveness in both IGBTs and current sensors fault diagnosis.},

Increased efficiency results from the flexibility of operating speed at different hydraulic heads. In doubly fed configuration, partial rated power converters feed the rotor circuit. Parallel-connected back-to-back voltage-source converter on rotor side is responsible for starting, braking (dynamic/regenerative), and speed (real power) control of the unit. This paper presents smooth starting and regenerative braking, and assesses performance under power converter and sensor faults of a 250-MW DFIM pump turbine unit to be commissioned in Tehri PSPP, India. Survivability of the unit during faults is analyzed based on current, speed, and dc-link voltage. Further, this paper investigates fault-tolerant operation of 250-MW DFIM unit at open-circuit fault in converters. A 2.2-kW DFIM is tested in the laboratory to corroborate the simulation.},

  abstract = {With a single shunt resistor, it is possible to sense the phase currents, although some dead regions exist around vertices of the voltage hexagon. In this article, an overmodulation method is presented for such single current shunt inverters. Regions near vertices of voltage hexagon are defined as holding regions, and the rest are defined as linear regions. The overmodulation strategy is developed based on the Fourier analysis: The magnitude of reference voltage determines the arc radius in the linear region and the holding angle of the holding region. By adjusting either the arc radius or the holding angle, the desired modulation index (MI) can be output. It is particularly useful for low-cost inverters, since it is implemented with an additional look-up table for induction motor or permanent magnet synchronous motor control. The linearity is maintained between the reference MI and its output MI until it reaches to the maximum, 12-step operation. In addition, the technique provides the seamless transition from space vector modulation to 12-step operation. The effectiveness is evidenced by the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Usually, design of distribution networks only considers the possibility of unidirectional power flow. Now, anticipation of massive small scale intermittent Distributed Generation (DG) in networks requires thinking in another way. The optimal sizing of MV/LV transformer and LV conductor is affected by the amount, size and distribution of DG power. But this factor, like the individual customer power demand, is a variable of statistical nature. Then, the main idea is to simulate the system with random demand and random renewable energy generation by a Monte Carlo process. The tool is an algorithm developed to solve the network under that situation. The next step is to set regulated limits of penetration. Then, the proposed regulated limits are varied. Actual allowable limits for each type situation are found repeating the process. Finally, levels of technical losses and service quality for different penetration levels are compared with respect to the basic network design. This allows proposing a likely regulated limit for insertion of individual small scale intermittent DG. This is a first step towards finding a consensus on the parameters to take into account, the objectives to pursue, and methodology to follow when regulating the insertion of intermittent renewable energy DG in Argentina.},

Based on the economical, technical and environmental benefits of the renewable energy related DG units, a thorough comparison between the two types of microgrid systems is provided. The paper also investigates the feasibility, control and energy management strategies of the two microgrid systems relying on the most current research works. Finally, the generalized relay tripping currents are derived and the protection strategies in microgrid systems are addressed in detail.

Insight on the design of the specific control parameters for proper operation of the various control loops is also provided. Furthermore, it is shown that the minimum permissible dc-link voltage of the converter is the same as that of a conventional voltage-sourced converter. Time-domain simulation studies in the MATLAB and Simulink software environments, as well as a 1.25- \$kW\$ experimental prototype confirm the effectiveness of the proposed converter under various normal and faulted operating scenarios.},

  abstract = {Anticipative driving of vehicles, considering the microscopic dynamics of the preceding traffic, can bring great improvement in the traffic flows in a connected vehicle environment (CVE), where 100\% vehicles frequently share their states using vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology. This paper addresses a partially CVE, where unconnected (manually driven) vehicles are mixed in the traffic, and proposes a novel method of comprehending traffic conditions that can be used for realizing highly anticipative driving. More specifically, we refer to anticipative driving as the predictive control of a host vehicle considering its preceding traffic conditions in an extended view. For enhanced perception of the traffic conditions on the road, a road-speed profile is proposed that concisely describes the mean speed in each small segment or cell of the road by effectively extracting information from traffic big data, i.e., broadcasted data from all surrounding vehicles to the host vehicle. This process of dynamically approximating the road-speed profile is performed in two steps. First, a conditional persistence prediction model is proposed to estimate the future states of the connected vehicles. Such predicted states can sufficiently compensate missing data from any unconnected vehicles. Second, the predicted time, position, and speed of the vehicles are then mapped onto the road cells, and subsequently, the corresponding cell speed is tuned by employing the weighted-moving average technique. Accuracy of both the persistence prediction model and the road-speed profile are empirically evaluated for different penetration of the connected vehicles. Finally, an anticipative driving scheme in a model predictive control framework is developed by incorporating the proposed road-speed profile, and performance of the anticipative driving is compared with the existing scheme that needs the CVE.},

The flat load-profile can be obtained using the Demand Response (DR) techniques with the storage elements and proper switching. The increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) supports the DR measures which facilitate both the utility and the consumer. The objective of DSM is to minimize the peak demand, electricity cost and emission rate by the effective utilization of storage with RES. This review article mainly focuses on the layers of microgrid, different techniques involved in DSM, mathematical models of DSM, latest optimization techniques and application of storage devices such as battery energy storage system and EVs in DSM. The state of the art of this article lies on the critical analysis related to datascience, advanced metering infrastructure and blockchain technologies which are the uniqueness of this article. The key issues and approaches are examined critically with the existing works to show how DSM implementation can be effectively done in the microgrids to reduce the electricity cost. This article helps the researchers to identify the research gap by gaining knowledge on the implementation of DSM in the microgrid and the factors affecting the DSM implementation. Few recommendations are discussed to provide future directions for researchers who started working in the DSM implementation.},

  abstract = {The concept of microgrid (MG) has been introduced as a solution to future electrical grid challenges such as the rapid increase of electrical demand, harvesting energy from renewable energy sources, and ensuring the quality and reliability of electricity supply. Distributed energy sources, as well as energy storage systems are interfaced with MGs through power electronic inverters. Control systems of the power electronic inverters in MGs play a key role in ensuring the perfect performance of MGs. This paper presents a comprehensive review of various control systems used in MGs. In particular, different levels of MG control systems have been investigated and corresponding control strategies at each level have been compared in detail. This paper categorizes MG control systems into four levels: 1- The converter output control that shapes the output current in order to control the flow of output power, 2- The power sharing algorithm that guarantees the even distribution of the load between parallel inverters, 3- The MG supervisory controller (secondary level) that deals with the supervisory control of the converters within the MG, and 4- The grid supervisory controller (tertiary level) that controls the flow of power between the main grid and the MG.},

This technology is a critical part of our energy infrastructure, and supports almost all important electrical applications and devices. Improvements in devices and advances in control concepts have led to steady improvements in power electronic applications. This is driving a tremendous expansion of their applications. Control in Power Electronics brings together a team of leading experts as contributors. This is the first book to thoroughly combine control methods and techniques for power electronic systems. The development of new semiconductor power components, new topologies of converters from one side coupled with advances in modern control theory and digital signal processors has made this book possible and presents the applications necessary for modern design engineers. The authors were originally brought together to share research and applications through the international Danfoss Professor Programme at Aalborg University in Denmark.ersonal computers would be unwieldy and inefficient without power electronic dc supplies. Portable communication devices and computers would also be impractical. High-performance lighting systems, motor controls, and a wide range of industrial controls depend on power electronics. In the near future we can expect strong growth in automotive applications, dc power supplies for communication systems, portable applications, and high-end converters. We are approaching a time when all electrical energy will be processed and controlled through power electronics somewhere in the path from generation to end use.},

  abstract = {National efforts to improve air quality in heavily populated urban communities-by reducing vehicular tailpipe emissions-have rekindled interest in the development of electric vehicle technology and infrastructure. Electric vehicles make ideal urban-commuter vehicles, for driving to and from, and within a city. However, electric vehicles are currently manufactured only in low volumes, and consequently the price of most commercially available electric vehicles remains high. It is possible, however, to build, an electric vehicle by ``converting'' a gasoline-powered vehicle, that is, replacing the internal combustion engine in an existing gasoline powered vehicle with an electric drive-train. This process is called ``electric vehicle conversion'', and has become popular among hobbyists, schools, and clean-air enthusiasts, as a means of providing an immediate solution to clean-air transportation. Many of the commercial electric vehicles sold in the USA are electric vehicle conversions. This paper addresses the design considerations involved in the conversion of a gasoline-powered vehicle to electric. Discussion of the various design elements in an electric vehicle conversion include: removal of internal combustion engine and related parts, choice of electric vehicle components, installation of electric vehicle components, and integration of electric vehicle accessory systems. For practical purposes, this paper limits consideration of EV components available at a cost that reflects high-volume production},

  abstract = {The fuel economy and all-electric range (AER) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are highly dependent on the onboard energy-storage system (ESS) of the vehicle. Energy-storage devices charge during low power demands and discharge during high power demands, acting as catalysts to provide energy boost. Batteries are the primary energy-storage devices in ground vehicles. Increasing the AER of vehicles by 15\% almost doubles the incremental cost of the ESS. This is due to the fact that the ESS of HEVs requires higher peak power while preserving high energy density. Ultracapacitors (UCs) are the options with higher power densities in comparison with batteries. A hybrid ESS composed of batteries, UCs, and/or fuel cells (FCs) could be a more appropriate option for advanced hybrid vehicular ESSs. This paper presents state-of-the-art energy-storage topologies for HEVs and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs). Battery, UC, and FC technologies are discussed and compared in this paper. In addition, various hybrid ESSs that combine two or more storage devices are addressed.},

A nonlinear separation principle is discussed, and the use of an extended high-gain observer as a disturbance estimator is covered. The most serious challenge in implementing high-gain observers is the effect of measurement noise, which is covered next.

The renewable energy resources (RERs) are considered the best suitable approach to generate electrical power at the distributed level since they offer benefits to the power systems as well as to the environment. Therefore, this paper presents the recent research work on multi-agents-based coordination for the optimal management of electrical energy and its proper controlling at the distributed level exploiting RERs. The multi-agent system (MAS) technique is discussed in detail along with the storage and protection system that solve the microgrid (MG) control and management issues efficiently. Several platforms to develop the MASs are addressed including those that empower the MG to control its configuration, generation capacity, power flow, and fault control. There are several controlling approaches used on distributed generation systems to efficiently operate the whole system comprising of centralized, distributed, and hybrid control techniques are discussed. A comprehensive description about different optimization techniques applied to the energy system have also been highlighted, particularly to identify the most common and effective technique that is currently applied to hybrid energy system at the distributed level. The analysis shows that the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the most useful and effective technique that has been applied since it can minimize the interruption costs, maximize the reliability, and optimize the operational schedules at the MG level.},

  abstract = {To increase situational awareness of maritime vessels and other entities and to enable their exchange of various information, the International Maritime Organization mandated the use of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in 2004. The AIS is a self-reporting system that uses the VHF radio link. However, any radio-based self-reporting system is prone to forgery, especially in situations where authentication of the message is not designed into the architecture. As AIS was designed in the 1990s when cyberattacks were in their infancy, it does not implement authentication or encryption; thus, it can be seen as fundamentally vulnerable against cyberattacks. This paper demonstrates and evaluates the impact of multiple cyberattacks on AIS via remote radio frequency (RF) links using transmission-enabled software-defined radio (SDR). Overall, we implemented and tested a total of 11 different tests/attacks on 19 AIS setups, using a controlled environment. The tested configurations were derived from heterogeneous platforms such as Windows, Android, generic receivers, and commercial transponders. Our aim is to enhance the early discovery of new vulnerabilities in AIS to effectively address AIS attacks in the nearest future. The results showed that approximately 89\% of the setups were affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the AIS protocol level. Besides implementing some existing attack ideas (e.g., spoofing, DoS, and flooding), we showed some novel attack concepts in the AIS context such as a coordinated attack, overwhelming alerts, and logical vulnerabilities, all of which have the potential to cause software/system crashes in the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, an implementation/specification flaw related to the AIS preamble was identified during the experiments, which may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices. The error-handling system in AIS was also investigated. Unlike the aviation sector's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), the maritime sector's AIS does not effectively support any error correction method, which may contribute to RF pollution and less effective use of the overall system. The consistency of our results for a comprehensive range of hardware-software configurations indicated the reliability of our approach, test system, and evaluation results.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a comparative study of two different speed observer techniques for a sensorless induction motor drive. Both Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) and sliding mode control theories are considered. The speed estimation algorithms based on both techniques are derived and implemented in a simulation program. The robustness of both speed estimation algorithms against load torque changes and motor parameters variations is investigated. The problems of PI controller associated with MRAS speed observer under these conditions are also investigated. The convergence of sliding mode speed observer is examined using Lyapunov theory. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a direct voltage control method for interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) with a single speed regulator. The method achieves maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) operation by controlling the magnitude and the angle of the voltage vector. For that, the mathematical model for the MTPA trajectory of the IPMSM is derived in the voltage plane. As such, no current sensor is needed, which makes the proposed strategy tolerant to current sensors failure unlike cascaded control loop based methodologies. Although no current sensor is used, the control strategy tracks MTPA trajectory by taking into account both voltage and current limits of the machine. The complete MTPA derivation in the voltage plane is presented in this paper; but, only the final solution is needed for real-time implementation. Henceforth, the simplicity of the control scheme combined with its current sensor dependence free characteristics make it a good candidate for real-time implementation in vehicular applications. The concept is developed and evaluated experimentally on a 10-HP IPMSM.},

  abstract = {Communication infrastructure (CI) in microgrids (MGs) allows for the application of different control architectures for the secondary control (SC) layer. The use of new SC architectures involving CI is motivated by the need to increase MG resilience and handle the intermittent nature of distributed generation units. The structure of SC is classified into three main categories, including centralized SC (CSC) with a CI, distributed SC (DISC) generally with a low-data-rate CI, and decentralized SC (DESC) with communication-free infrastructure. To meet the MGs' operational constraints and optimize performance, control and communication must be utilized simultaneously in different control layers. In this survey, we review and classify all types of SC policies from CI-based methods to communication-free policies, including CSC, averaging-based DISC, consensus-based DISC methods, containment pinning consensus, event-triggered DISC, washout-filter-based DESC, and state-estimation-based DESC. Each structure is scrutinized from the viewpoint of the relevant literature. Challenges such as clock drifts, cyber-security threats, and the advantage of event-triggered approaches are presented. Fully decentralized approaches based on state-estimation and observation methods are also addressed. Although these approaches eliminate the need of any CI for the voltage and frequency restoration, during black start process or other functionalities related to the tertiary layer, a CI is required. Power hardware-in-the-loop experimental tests are carried out to compare the merits and applicability of different SC structures.},

There have also been a number of offline (i.e., design-time) methods that focus on optimizing FDI performance (e.g., trading off detection performance versus cost). However, design-time algorithms are not tuned to optimize performance for different operating regions of system behavior. To do this, would need to define online measures of sensitivity and robustness, and use them to select the best residual set online as system behavior transitions between operating regions. In this paper we develop a quantitative measure of residual performance, called the detectability ratio that applies to additive and multiplicative uncertainties when determining the best residual set in different operating regions. We discuss this methodology and demonstrate its effectiveness using a case study.},

The computation of y(t,t 0,y 0) and the sensitivity matrix play an important role in the efficient numerical solution of boundary-value problems, optimal-control problems and for parameter identification in dynamical systems.

Here a number of implementations are introduced, treating non-stiff, stiff and differential algebraic equations. The basic new idea is to regard the numerical approximation of as the solution of the variational differential equation of a linearised IVP with approximation of the linear right-hand side by the difference quotient of the original non-linear f. For further implementations a general guideline is given how integration codes can be extended to the simultaneous efficient and reliable computation of the sensitivity matrix. It may help a numerical software writer who is implementing an integration method to supply the method with an additional option for sensitivity analysis, or even an experienced user of numerical integration software who makes extended use of sensitivity analysis to adapt a routine to his requirements.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the new current reconstruction method of three-phase currents in case of using dc-link shunt resistor for three-phase AC motor. When dc-link shunt resistor is used for the acquisition of phase currents, there are the immeasurable regions in the hexagon of Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation(SVPWM). The conventional methods used the shift of the switching patterns of SVPWM to extend the region of the measurable area from the immeasurable area. Thus, these methods cause the audible noise, the current distortion and deteriorate the control performance of the motor drive system. The proposed method uses the current equations of the combined equivalent circuits of the PWM inverter and AC motor according to the switching patterns of the PWM inverter. This method can reconstruct three-phase current without the shift of the switching pattern of SVPWM and producing the audible noise. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through computer simulation and the experimental results.},

The minimum required time to measure the currents in a three-phase inverters with shunt resistors has also been analyzed. By the analysis, the longest time in minimum required time is AD conversion time. To shorten the minimum required time, this paper proposed a sample-and-hold(S/H) circuit implemented at the inverter current signal output to retain the current signal. When the linear operation region of an inverter with S/H was compared with that without it, the modulation index was increased by 7.8 \%. Inverters with S/H circuits can employ the traditional software algorithms, such as the voltage injection method or current restoration method, and it will yield further increase the modulation index.},

Conventional shunt resistor-based current sensing methods have immeasurable areas in the voltage vector plane. Since motor control performance is degraded by the immeasurable area, various current reconstruction techniques have been proposed to expand the measurement range. Nevertheless, the software algorithm is quite complex, and the reconstruction ability is still unsatisfactory. In the proposed method, shunt resistors are located in series with the inverter output lines to obtain the motor phase currents. Both ends of the shunt resistors are at the high-potential as the dc-link voltage. High-potential voltages are lowered to the common-mode voltage level of the analog amplifier using voltage divider, and voltage drops across shunt resistors are detected by instrumentation amplifiers. Immeasurable areas are completely eliminated because phase currents can be detected directly through line shunt resistors. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed current sensing method.},

The rotor speed is regarded as a parameter, and the composite states consist of the original states and the rotor speed. The extended Kalman filter is employed to identify the speed of an induction motor and rotor flux based on the measured quantities such as stator currents and DC link voltage. The estimated speed is used for vector control and overall speed control. Since the current control is performed at a synchronous rotating reference frame, the estimated speed information is also used for the reference frame transformation of the current controller. Computer simulations and experiments of the speed control have been carried out to test the usefulness of the speed estimation algorithm. The experimental results show that the performance of the speed estimation is very good},

The lumped parameters are slowly time-varying, except when a vehicle experiences gear shift. Combined parameters adaptation and throttle/brake control algorithm have been developed. The performance of the proposed control algorithm has been evaluated via simulations and vehicle tests. Since the proposed control algorithm has been designed using a generic form of vehicle model, it can be implemented for different classes of vehicles without any information about vehicle powertrain and brake system. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the vehicle speed tracking performance is robust to external disturbance.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a systematic method to obtain ultimate bounds for both continuous- and discrete-time perturbed systems. The method is based on a componentwise analysis of the system in modal coordinates and thus exploits the system geometry as well as the perturbation structure without requiring calculation of a Lyapunov function for the system. The method is introduced for linear systems having constant componentwise perturbation bounds and is then extended to the case of state-dependent perturbation bounds. This extension enables the method to be applied to non-linear systems by treating the perturbed non-linear system as a linear system with a perturbation bounded by a non-linear function of the state. Examples are provided where the proposed systematic method yields bounds that are tighter or at least not worse than those obtained via standard Lyapunov analysis. We also show how our method can be combined with Lyapunov analysis to improve on the bounds provided by either approach.},

If an unpredictable fault occurs in any of these sensors, the performance of the drive deteriorates or even becomes unstable. Most of the existing works are limited to fault diagnosis of one or two sensors due to complexity. Therefore, to provide a continuous drive operation regardless of any of the sensor faults, an advanced fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme that comprises of higher order sliding mode (HOSM) based observers and controllers is proposed. Two HOSM observers and one Luenberger observer are designed to generate the respective residuals and provide the detection of all sensor faults. Moreover, HOSM controllers are developed to ensure finite-time convergence of the error trajectories after the fault reconfiguration. The proposed FTC scheme reduces the existing chattering phenomenon with good performance in terms of convergence speed and steady-state error. Evaluation results on a three-phase PMSM are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed FTC approach.},

The proposed fault-tolerant system is based on field orientation control with additional fault tolerance functionality. A current predictive method for OPF detection is presented, together with an estimation of the threshold level for detection. The proposed method is based on the prediction of stator current for the next sampling interval. Furthermore, a new method for postfault operation of the machine is proposed. For optimal performance of the complete drive, a prefiring angle is introduced in order to avoid the temporary generation of negative torque. This improvement increases the average generated postfault electromagnetic torque, and consequently, it reduces the mechanical stress on various machine parts. The proposed fault detection and postfault operation solutions were simulated in MATLAB, and they were also tested on an experimental setup. The results show several advantages of the proposed fault-tolerant solution, like its short fault-detection time, substantial robustness against variation of machine parameters or load fluctuations, and negligible implementation costs, since no hardware modifications are needed. The fault detection algorithm does not require high computing power, and it operates well even during transients.},

The observer is realized using the measured motor voltages and currents; it can be used to provide field orientation in a sensorless control scheme. The observer estimates the stationary frame fluxes of the induction motor and is developed using switching (sliding-mode) terms based on the current mismatches. The novelty is the design method used: first, a sensored observer is constructed; second, the observer is made sensorless by replacing the speed with a speed estimate; last, a gain design is found that allows accurate estimation of the rotor flux angle. The observer is analyzed with Lyapunov-based methods. It is found that with the proposed design, when an inaccurate speed signal is used, the resulting flux estimates are in phase with the real fluxes{\textemdash}this yields the correct rotor flux angle. The magnitudes of the estimated fluxes are inversely proportional with the speed signal used. The theoretical development is supported by simulation results and experimental tests. The advantages of the method are explained.},

  abstract = {Induction machines have recently been very popular in variable-speed drives, because of their robust construction and relatively low manufacturing costs (brushless), maintenance-free and well-matured control methods. However, for high-precision control and efficiency optimization one needs the information on the rotor speed which can be measured using different speed sensors. All sensors require a mounting space and cabling, they also generate extra costs and reduce system reliability. Therefore, many of the recent research efforts have been dedicated to sensorless or encoderless electrical drives offering such considerable advantages as: lower cost, reduced size and hardware complexity of the drive system, elimination of sensor cables, lower maintenance requirements, possible operation in aggressive environment, higher noise immunity, reliable and user friendly operation. In this article all well-known sensorless techniques are shortly addressed, but the main focus is on the solutions based on the Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) concept. The mathematical models and schemes of all types of MRAS-type speed estimators known from the literature are gathered in this article. The comparative analysis of these speed estimators is done from the following points of view: the speed adaptation mechanism derivation based on the Lyapunov theory, stability problems near zero speed and in the regenerating operation mode, and the sensitivity of MRAS estimators to induction machine parameter changes.},

The non-linear part satisfies the Lipschitz condition, whilst the uncertain part is a bounded function. A sliding mode observer is designed to yield feedforward compensation input to stabilize the error estimation system with and without a Lipschitz non-linearity. Sufficient conditions for stability of the Thau observer are also proposed. These conditions ensure the stability of the non-linear observer by selecting a suitable observer gain matrix. In general, when the system contains unmatched uncertainty, ultimate boundedness is obtained. The ultimate boundedness radius depends upon the defined `distance of the unmatched uncertainty'. Some sufficient conditions may ensure the stability of a non-linear observer for systems with uncertainties.},

Two kinds of neural networks (NN) were proposed for diagnostic purposes: multilayer perceptron networks and self organizing Kohonen networks. Neural networks were trained and tested using measurement data of stator current and mechanical vibration spectra. The efficiency of developed neural detectors was evaluated. Feedforward NN with very simple internal structure, used for the detection of all fault kinds, gave satisfactory results, which is very important in practical realization. Experiments with Kohonen networks indicated that they could be used for the initial classification of motor faults, as an introductory step before the proper neural detector based on multiplayer perceptron is used. The obtained results lead to a conclusion that neural detectors for rotor and stator faults as well as for rolling bearings and supply asymmetry faults can be developed based on measurement data acquired on-line in the drive system.},

Two self-adjusting observers derived from a modified current-based model reference adaptive system (CB-MRAS) are presented. Finally, the recursive least squares method was used to estimate the parameters of the used observers. The method, in the proposed solution, provides a very fast and accurate finding of the observer parameters while maintaining relative simplicity and ease of implementation. The presented algorithm eliminates the CB-MRAS observer dependence on the induction motor parameters and also compensates for the inaccuracies in the evaluation of the stator voltage vector. The proposed fault-tolerant control offers the drive operation while either a speed sensor or one/two current sensors fault occurs. The drive still works with the direct field-oriented control even when no current sensors are healthy. The proposed scheme was simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink software environment. Then the algorithm was implemented in a floating-point digital signal controller (DSC) TMS320F28335 and tested on an induction motor drive prototype of rated power of 2.2 kW to validate the proposed schemes.},

  abstract = {The conventional direct torque control (DTC) of induction motor drive has two main problems such as higher ripple in torque, flux and variable switching frequency. These problems are mainly due to the hysteresis controllers. Appreciable reduction of torque and flux ripple can be achieved by increasing the inverter switching frequency. Most of the torque ripples reduction methods in literature are centered on this concept. The hysteresis based approach also results in variable switching frequency that depends on operating conditions at particular speed. Hence a method for increasing the switching frequency and at the same time maintaining constant switching frequency is needed. Most researches have chosen the space vector pulse width modulation based DTC (SVM-DTC) scheme. In this paper, first the torque and flux ripple in the conventional DTC method are shown and the improvement achieved by using proposed DTC method based on slip angle is presented. A new method such as slip angle control of induction motor drive based on DTC are proposed, analyzed, simulated, and tested. It is shown that this method progressively reduces torque and flux ripple.},

  abstract = {To meet the fast-growing energy demand and, at the same time, tackle environmental concerns resulting from conventional energy sources, renewable energy sources are getting integrated in power networks to ensure reliable and affordable energy for the public and industrial sectors. However, the integration of renewable energy in the ageing electrical grids can result in new risks/challenges, such as security of supply, base load energy capacity, seasonal effects, and so on. Recent research and development in microgrids have proved that microgrids, which are fueled by renewable energy sources and managed by smart grids (use of smart sensors and smart energy management system), can offer higher reliability and more efficient energy systems in a cost-effective manner. Further improvement in the reliability and efficiency of electrical grids can be achieved by utilizing dc distribution in microgrid systems. DC microgrid is an attractive technology in the modern electrical grid system because of its natural interface with renewable energy sources, electric loads, and energy storage systems. In the recent past, an increase in research work has been observed in the area of dc microgrid, which brings this technology closer to practical implementation. This paper presents the state-of-the-art dc microgrid technology that covers ac interfaces, architectures, possible grounding schemes, power quality issues, and communication systems. The advantages of dc grids can be harvested in many applications to improve their reliability and efficiency. This paper also discusses benefits and challenges of using dc grid systems in several applications. This paper highlights the urgent need of standardizations for dc microgrid technology and presents recent updates in this area.},

In this drive configuration, open-ended motor phase windings are fed with two voltage source inverters from each end, which are powered with separate battery banks. Power semiconductor switching devices, which constitute the dual-inverter system, are susceptible for the development of Open-Circuit (OC) and Short-Circuit (SC) faults on the fly, seriously hampering the reliability of the drive. This paper proposes simple algorithms to diagnose both of these faults. In particular, the SC fault detection is essentially pre-emptive in nature, as the acts of detection and the subsequent circuit-reconfiguration are carried out before the SC fault can cause over-currents in healthy switching devices and damage them. The fault diagnosis algorithms employ simple analog circuits and Hall-current sensors, making them inexpensive and reliable. This paper also presents strategies for the dynamic reconfiguration of the power circuit, which ensures that the charge residing in the healthy battery bank is utilised even if the associated inverter develops a fault. The effectiveness of the proposed power circuit, fault diagnosis algorithms and reconfiguration strategies is assessed with simulation studies and are validated experimentally.},

The review shows significant progress that has been achieved in the performance aspects of angle sensors, overcoming the challenges introduced by new and specific applications. Progress is also visible in effectively utilizing the emerging allied technologies on the sensing and electronics field for the development of high-end angle sensors. As a part of the review, the important sensing techniques utilized for the angle sensors are identified and carefully looked at the advantages and limitations of those. Besides, the potential areas for improvements are also suggested. The important techniques employed to design and develop the angle sensors are based on capacitive, inductive, magneto-resistive, and optical schemes. Signal conditioning circuits, analog or digital, or a combination of it, are necessary to derive the best from the sensing elements. They play a vital role in the overall performance of the sensor. The review addresses the advancement in the sensing element, methodology, and signal conditioning aspect in detail.

  abstract = {Batteries used for providing backup power in renewable energy sources (RES) fed standalone power systems often suffer from a limited lifetime because of high charging and discharging currents arising from sudden changes in load and/or generation. To prevent this, supercapacitors are used to supply the high-frequency power surges. In this paper, a new way of interfacing Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (Battery+ Supercapacitor) with RES and loads by employing a Current Fed Dual Active Bridge converter based Multi-Port Converter (MPC) is proposed. The proposed approach enables the MPC to regulate the load voltage while tracking the maximum power point (MPP) of the RES and protecting the battery from transients arising from variations in load and/or renewable generation. The Supercapacitor is used for tracking MPP so that the transient changes in RES generation do not cause a sudden rise/fall in the battery current. The employed MPC structure is designed in such a way that most of the power processing takes place in one stage only resulting in lower losses. The number of switches is reduced by merging the power conversion stages, which helps in keeping the cost low. Experimental results on a laboratory prototype under various static and dynamic conditions are presented.},

  abstract = {Supercapacitors (SC) are required in EVs to supply the large power required during starting and acceleration, which strains the battery and deteriorates its life. To match the Supercapacitor voltage and interface it to the DC link, a DC/DC converter is required in between. A multi-port converter (MPC) based on Dual Active Bridge topology is proposed in this paper, which aims at electric vehicle applications for interfacing battery and supercapacitor to the drive train. Dual active bridge converters provide isolation, bidirectional power capability and also enable soft switching, all of which are highly desirable features for an EV application. In the proposed converter, the battery is operated in current control mode to regulate the battery current and to protect the battery from power surges, whereas the difference power is supplied by the Supercapacitor. The proposed MPC can also be used to charge the battery from any DC input (higher than battery voltage) by regulating the battery current. This eliminates the need for an onboard DC/DC converter. The proposed converter has been validated using simulations and those results are presented.},

The proposed method is based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and the orthogonality between the rotor flux space vector and its back electromotive force (EMF) space vector. Rotor flux is estimated using stator voltage equations without integrating the back EMF components in the stationary reference frame and the well-known difficulties with the implementation of pure integrators are thus avoided. Moreover, the proposed method ensures successful magnetization of a speed-sensorless squirrel-cage induction generator at nonzero speeds which makes it suitable for wind power applications. Experimental results on a 560 kW squirrel-cage induction generator are presented to confirm the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method.},

The framework is exemplified by way of a microgrid that is connected to an external grid via a transformer and includes the following players: a middle-size train station with integrated photovoltaic power production system, a small energy production plant composed of urban wind turbines, and a surrounding district including residences and small businesses. The system is described by Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), in which each player is modelled as an individual agent aiming at a particular goal, (i) decreasing its expenses for power purchase or (ii) increasing its revenues from power selling. The context in which the agents operate is uncertain due to the stochasticity of operational and environmental parameters, and the technical failures of the renewable power generators. The uncertain operational and environmental parameters of the microgrid are quantified in terms of Prediction Intervals (PIs) by a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) {\textendash} trained Neural Network (NN). Under these uncertainties, each agent is seeking for optimal goal-directed actions planning by Robust Optimization (RO). The developed framework is shown to lead to an increase in system performance, evaluated in terms of typical reliability (adequacy) indicators for energy systems, such as Loss of Load Expectation (LOLE) and Loss of Expected Energy (LOEE), in comparison with optimal planning based on expected values of the uncertain parameters.},

Hence, it provides planners with an essential tool to evaluate downtime costs and decide technology deployments based on quantitative risk assessments by allowing to compare the effect that converter topologies and microgrid architecture choices have on availability. Conventional architectures with single-input converters and alternative configurations with multiple-input converters (MICs) are considered. Calculations yield that all microgrid configurations except those utilizing center converters achieve similar availability of 6-nines. Three converter topologies are used as representatives of many other circuits. These three benchmark circuits are the boost, the isolated SEPIC (ISEPIC), and the current-source half-bridge. Marginal availability differences are observed for different circuit topology choices, although architectures with MICs are more sensitive to this choice. MICs and, in particular, the ISEPIC, are identified as good compromise options for dc microgrids source interfaces. The analysis also models availability influence of local energy storage, both in batteries and generators' fuel. These models provide a quantitative way of comparing dc microgrids with conventional backup energy systems. Calculations based on widely accepted data in industry supports the analysis.},

In addition, an overmodulation algorithm for a 12-step output, which corresponds to the largest voltage in a DC link shunt inverter, is proposed, and a current recovery method in the overmodulation region is proposed. To determine how to ensure a linear output voltage, the fundamental frequency of the output voltage is analyzed through a Fourier series, and a new voltage vector whose fundamental frequency amplitude is equal to the amplitude of the command voltage is calculated. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulation and experimentation.

There is evidence that bipolar dc networks are advantageous due to higher reliability and increased power transmission capability. In such a network, currents are typically unbalanced and, thus, increase feeder losses. Another challenge in dc active distribution networks is the overall voltage stability due to the presence of distributed energy resources and loads with their power electronics interfaces.

Unbalanced, non-sinusoidal pulse width modulation (PWM) references may be required when converters provide auxiliary services, such as negative-sequence compensation. Since PWM references cannot exceed dc-bus voltage defined limits without causing overmodulation, the maximum positive-sequence voltage producible by microgrid-interactive converters may be diminished unless reference waveforms are adjusted. In this paper, a technique for maximizing the linear modulation region by injecting a common mode component into PWM references is proposed for microgrid-interactive cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters. The technique presented can be implemented in real-time without lookup tables, is controller independent, is compatible with any carrier-based PWM method, enabling its use for symmetric and asymmetric CHB, and enables continued operation after internal fault events when utilized with fault tolerant PWM schemes. Experimental data verify the common mode injection technique.},

It is able to reduce the acoustical noise, the torque, flux, current, and speed pulsations during steady state. The DTC transient merits are preserved, while better quality steady-state performance is produced in sensorless implementation for a wide speed range. The flux and torque estimator is presented and an improved voltage-current model speed observer is introduced.

  abstract = {A sensorless induction machine drive is presented, in which the principles of variable-structure control and direct torque control (DTC) are combined to ensure high-performance operation in the steady state and under transient conditions. The drive employs a new torque and flux controller, the "linear and variable-structure control", which realizes accurate and robust control in a wide speed range. Conventional DTC transient merits are preserved, while the steady-state behavior is significantly improved. The full-order state observer is a sliding-mode one, which does not require the rotor speed adaptation and provides accurate state estimation in the entire speed range. The proposed scheme is a complete variable-structure solution that allows persistent sensorless operation of the drive at very low speeds, including zero and 3 r/min, with full load. Simulations and extensive experimental results confirm the robustness, accuracy, quickness, and low-chattering operation of the drive.},

  abstract = {A sensorless speed/position tracking control scheme for induction motors is proposed subject to unknown load torque via adaptive strictly positive real (SPR) approach design. A special nonlinear coordinate transform is first provided to reform the dynamical model of the induction motor. The information on rotor fluxes can thus be derived from the dynamical model to decide on the proportion of input voltage in the d-q frame under the constraint of the maximum power transfer property of induction motors. Based on the SPR approach, the speed and position control objectives can be achieved. The proposed control scheme is to provide the speed/position control of induction motors while lacking the knowledge of some mechanical system parameters, such as the motor inertia, motor damping coefficient, and the unknown payload. The adaptive control technique is thus involved in the field oriented control scheme to deal with the unknown parameters. The thorough proof is derived to guarantee the stability of the speed and position of control systems of induction motors. Besides, numerical simulation and experimental results are also provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract = {The DC-link capacitor is a crucial component in two-level three-phase voltage source inverters (VSIs) to provide a low impedance path for the high-frequency input current and to stabilize the fluctuating DC-link voltage. When selecting the DC-link capacitor, not only the rated voltage and current but also the capacitance should be carefully considered. Ideally, the larger the capacitance of DC-link capacitor, the better for the DC-link voltage stabilization. However, in practice, there is a limitation to infinitely increasing the capacitance because of cost, volume, and size problems. Thus, the DC-link voltage ripple should be analyzed to help in precisely selecting the appropriate capacitance of DC-link capacitor, especially when using film capacitors. In general, the DC-link voltage ripple depends on the pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies. This paper presents the DC-link voltage ripple analysis, particularly when the generalized discontinuous PWM (GDPWM) strategy, which is optimal for minimizing the switching losses under all operating conditions of VSI, is applied. Moreover, an equation is proposed to help selecting the minimum capacitance of DC-link capacitor. Simulation and experimental results with a motor drive system are also provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented analysis.},

  abstract = {Various torque distribution and stability control algorithms have been studied along with the development of four-wheel drive vehicles. But, most of those algorithms focus only on performance improvement. Since the independent four-wheel drive system is based on four drive motors, faults can occur in a motor or an inverter. If a fault occurs, the vehicle stability is not guaranteed and a fatal accident can occur. In this study, the fault-tolerant stability control algorithm for remaining healthy motors is proposed. This fault-tolerant control (FTC) system contains torque distribution and stability control algorithms. For accurate control of motor allocation, driving conditions such as under/over-steering, and steering direction should be considered, as well as vehicle condition such as fault motor location and motor performance limits. The proposed FTC is evaluated with two fault conditions (e.g., front motor fault, rear motor fault) under straight acceleration and constant steering acceleration scenarios. The behavior characteristics and driving risks caused by failures of motors while driving are analyzed. Also, the FTC algorithm is accurately follow a desired path within a minimum error range that the driver can cover.},

Droop control can respond to inevitable uncertainties in the load and RES. However, this leads to frequency and voltage deviations, and the generator output power may deviate from the optimal point. To restore the frequency and voltage of both ac and dc grids while reducing generation cost at short time intervals, a model predictive control based optimization problem is formulated to update the set-points of the available resources including the interlinking converter and distributed generators. With the sensitivities, which help to linearly express the frequency and voltage for resource output power, the problem can be approximated to a quadratic programming model. In addition, to consider the effect of the reactive power on the frequency and improve the accuracy, the second-order frequency sensitivity is calculated and applied selectively. The proposed method was tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus system connected to a sample dc grid. The simulation results validate its performance for reliable and economic operation in an islanded HMG.},

Among various factors that affect the reliability of the network, the intermittent connection (IC) of the network cable is a common but challenging troubleshooting problem since its location is difficult to identify. IC problems may result in degraded network performance or system level failures in severe cases. In this paper, a novel model-based fault location method is developed for IC problems on controller area networks. By passively capturing IC-induced network errors, two sets of error events are defined for each node, based on which generalized zero inflated Poisson models are used to describe the patterns of the error events. A two-step IC fault location procedure is proposed by examining the statistical significance of the corresponding error events using the fitted models. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method on different IC location scenarios. Experiment results show that the locations of the IC problems identified by the proposed method agree well with the experiment setup conditions.},

The individual signal transmission channels arise naturally from customer specification on selected plant outputs and describe the signal transmission between each specified output and its associated reference signal. Advantage is taken of the fact that each individual channel is single-input single-output to permit classical design chiefly of the Nyquist-Bode type. Thus, individual channel design is not a design method per se; rather, it is a global structural framework wherein the possibilities and limitations for local loop shaping design of a particular plant are made apparent from the outset.

However, reducing timing phase jitter just by narrowing the bandwidth of the timing recovery loop will decrease the capability of tracking the time variant channel. To avoid this drawback, the only way to improve pattern-dependent timing jitter is to utilize some signal processing means. In this paper, we propose a modified Gardner detection scheme for symbol timing recovery of multilevel PAM/QAM signals, which offers a theoretically jitter-free phase detector even in the case of non-coherent demodulation. Also in practical applications, such detector with reduced complexity can provide a remarkable amount of jitter reduction. Simulation results show that the proposed modification leads to significant performance improvement for multilevel PAM/QAM signals.},

The response in the stator voltage to the signal depends on the orientation of the signal relative to that of the rotor flux. The dependency is due to the reaction of the mechanical system, and it is used to control the orientation error to zero. In the experiments, the controller operated successfully under nominal torque both at zero speed and at zero frequency. Slow and fast speed reversals under nominal torque were also successful. In addition, the system was capable of withstanding both motoring and generating load torque steps up to 50\% of nominal torque.},

  abstract = {Although the concept of variable-speed drives, based on utilization of multiphase machines, dates back to the late 1960s, it was not until the mid- to late 1990s that multiphase drives became serious contenders for various applications. These include electric ship propulsion, locomotive traction, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, ldquomore-electricrdquo aircraft, and high-power industrial applications. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the interest for such drive systems worldwide, resulting in a huge volume of work published during the last ten years. An attempt is made in this paper to provide a brief review of the current state of the art in the area. After addressing the reasons for potential use of multiphase rather than three-phase drives and the available approaches to multiphase machine designs, various control schemes are surveyed. This is followed by a discussion of the multiphase voltage source inverter control. Various possibilities for the use of additional degrees of freedom that exist in multiphase machines are further elaborated. Finally, multiphase machine applications in electric energy generation are addressed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a power control strategy is proposed for a low-voltage microgrid, where the mainly resistive line impedance, the unequal impedance among distributed generation (DG) units, and the microgrid load locations make the conventional frequency and voltage droop method unpractical. The proposed power control strategy contains a virtual inductor at the interfacing inverter output and an accurate power control and sharing algorithm with consideration of both impedance voltage drop effect and DG local load effect. Specifically, the virtual inductance can effectively prevent the coupling between the real and reactive powers by introducing a predominantly inductive impedance even in a low-voltage network with resistive line impedances. On the other hand, based on the predominantly inductive impedance, the proposed accurate reactive power sharing algorithm functions by estimating the impedance voltage drops and significantly improves the reactive power control and sharing accuracy. Finally, considering the different locations of loads in a multibus microgrid, the reactive power control accuracy is further improved by employing an online estimated reactive power offset to compensate the effects of DG local load power demands. The proposed power control strategy has been tested in simulation and experimentally on a low-voltage microgrid prototype.},

Sensor faults or data attacks have a great impact on the stability and quality of MG. Existing methods commonly assume that the sensing information from distributed generations (DGs) is healthy or satisfies some ideal conditions. To achieve resilient secondary voltage restoration, a novel adaptive fault tolerant control scheme is proposed. Since the bounds of the time-varying faults are unknown, sufficient conditions are first derived to guarantee the voltage tracking errors to be uniformly ultimately bounded. It is also theoretically shown that the frequency restoration and power sharing can be ensured stable of the overall ac MG system by using the same control scheme. Compared with the existing distributed control methods for secondary control of MG, the considered problem with unknown boundaries sensor faults is more challenging and still not well explored.},

With two current sensors, there is no current method addressing the diagnosis of both IGBT open-circuit (OC) faults and current sensor faults. In order to solve this problem, this article proposes a method which innovatively combines two kinds of diagnosis variables, line voltage deviations and phase voltage deviations. The unique faulty characteristics of diagnosis variables for each fault are extracted and utilized to distinguish the fault. Using an average model, the method only needs the signals already available in the controller. Both IGBT OC faults and current sensor faults can be detected quickly in inverter mode and rectifier mode, so that the converter can be protected in a timely way to avoid further damages. In addition, error-adaptive thresholds are adopted to make the method robust. Effects such as system unbalance are analyzed to ensure that the method is robust and feasible. Simulation and experimental results are used to verify and validate the effectiveness of the method. Index Terms{\textemdash}Current control, fault detection, inverters.},

The fault detection algorithm is based on the current observer, in which an adaptive threshold and different fault duration times are considered.

In this study, a modified sliding mode control (SMC) is applied to achieve fault-tolerant control of electric vehicles with four-wheel-independent-steering (4WIS) and four-wheel-independent-driving (4WID). Unlike in traditional SMC, in this approach the steering geometry is re-arranged according to the location of faulty wheels in the modified SMC. Three SMC control laws for longitudinal velocity control, lateral velocity control and yaw rate control are designed based on specific vehicle motion scenarios. In addition the actuator-grouping SMC method is proposed so that driving actuators are grouped and each group of actuators can be used to achieve the specific control target, which avoids the strong coupling effect between each control target. Simulation results prove that the proposed modified SMC can achieve good vehicle dynamics control performance in normal driving and large steering angle turning scenarios. In addition, the proposed actuator-grouping SMC can solve the coupling effect of different control targets and the control performance is improved.},

Key issues for the control and operation of microgrid include integration technologies and energy management schemes. This paper presents an overview of grid integration and energy management strategies of microgrids. It covers a review of power electronics interface topologies for different types of distributed generation (DG) units in a microgrid, a discussion of energy management strategies, as well as the DG interfacing converter control schemes. Considering the intermittent nature of many renewable energy based DG units, the ancillary services of DGs using the available interfacing converter rating are also discussed in the paper.},

Under the standard decoupling approximation for bus angle differences, the reactive power flow of each inverter can be controlled by manipulating the voltage amplitudes of itself and its neighbor inverters. By designing an adaptive resilient cooperative control scheme, accurate reactive power sharing can be guaranteed even in the presence of communication faults. Some simulation results are presented to verify the superiority of the proposed control approach compared with the existing methods.},

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method of fault-tolerant control for AMT gear-shifting engaging process. By using the measured current of actuator motor and angular displacement of actuator, the gear-shifting engaging load torque table is built and updated before the occurrence of the sensor fault. Meanwhile, residual between estimated and measured angular displacements is used to detect the sensor fault. Once the residual exceeds a determined fault threshold, the sensor fault is detected. Then, switch control is triggered, and the current observer and load torque table estimates an actual gear-shifting position to replace the measured one to continue controlling the gear-shifting process. Numerical and experiment tests are carried out to evaluate the reliability and feasibility of proposed methods, and the results show that the performance of estimation and control is satisfactory.},

This article aims to conduct the sizing optimization of HESS and apply an adaptive real-time EMS for practice. First, considering the system cost and battery lifespan, the multiobjective grey wolf optimizer is used to obtain the Pareto front. Second, with optimal parameters, the offline optimal power splitting results by dynamic programming (DP) under different driving patterns are analyzed. Then, the random forests (RF) method is used to learn control rules from the DP results. Driving pattern recognition (DPR) is implemented by the support vector machine (SVM). The intelligent EMS is composed of RF to guide power distribution and SVM to realize DPR. Finally, a combined load cycle involving different driving patterns is used for verification. Results illustrate that the proposed adaptive RF-based EMS can demonstrate a notable superiority in terms of battery protection, ultra-capacitor utilization, and system efficiency. Compared with the ordinary RF-based EMS without DPR, the proposed method can reduce total energy loss by 0.74\%{\textendash}9.49\%, and reduce the battery Ah-throughput by 0.5\%{\textendash}19.83\% under unknown driving cycles.},

Firstly, as the vehicle longitudinal velocity is not fixed but time-varying, a polytope with finite vertices is adopted to construct a linear parameter varying vehicle system model. Secondly, since network-induced delay and actuator fault inevitably occur in the control system, a novel Lyapunov function is formulated to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system. Moreover, an advanced event triggered communication scheme is proposed for the co-design of robust automatic steering controller, which is quite effective to reduce network communication burden and enhance resource utilization of the shared band-limited in-vehicle communication network. Finally, numerical simulations on two cases are carried out to evaluate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller. Compared with existing studies, the proposed controller contributes greatly to the economization of communication resource and improvement of path following performance and lateral stability.},

  abstract = {Four-wheel independently driven skid-steered mobile robots are widely used in the fields of industrial automation and outdoor exploration. In most of existing controllers of skid-steered mobile robots, the wheel velocities are controlled independently to track the desired velocities from the high-level kinematic controller. However, this kind of control method may lead to chattering phenomenon of skidsteered mobile robots in practice, when the desired velocity commands of four wheels are not matched under different ground conditions. In this paper, the coordinated control problem is investigated for the four-wheel independently driven skid steer mobile robots, so as to solve the chattering phenomenon and also achieve good control performance under different ground conditions. Since the mobile robots are overactuated and lack of suspension systems, a coordinated adaptive robust control scheme integrated with torque allocation technique is proposed. First, an adaptive robust control law is developed to attenuate the negative effects of load variations and uncertainties. Second, instead of directly giving the desired velocity commands, a torque control and allocation algorithm is developed to regulate the driving torque of each wheel motor. A coordinated control law with considering the wheel slip compensation is also proposed. Comparative experiments are carried out, and the results show the proposed scheme can avoid the chattering problem and achieve the excellent performance under different ground conditions.},

  abstract = {Independently controlled multimotor drives are typically realized by using a common dc link and independent sets of three-phase inverters and motors. In the case of an open-circuit fault in an inverter leg, one motor becomes single phase. To enable continued controllable operation by eliminating single phasing, the supply for the motor phase with the faulted inverter leg can be paralleled to a healthy leg of another inverter using hardware reconfiguration. Hence, the two motors are now supplied from a five-leg inverter, which has inherent voltage and current limitations. Theoretically, violating the voltage limit leads to inverter overmodulation and large torque oscillations. It is shown here that the finite-control-set model predictive control, designed to control the machines' stator flux and torque, can consider the inherent voltage limit dynamically in the control loop. Apart from preserving the independent control of the two machines, the additional constraint consideration significantly widens the operating speed ranges of the machines. In particular, it is shown that, whenever the voltage limit is entered, the controller reduces the stator flux level automatically, without requiring external flux reference change. The obtained performance is illustrated using experimental results and is also compared to the conventional two-motor field-oriented control scheme. The control concept is thus fully experimentally verified.},

It adopts an outer-rotor topology, which can help generate a large drive torque, in order to achieve prominent dynamic performance of the vehicle. Moreover, by adopting single-layer concentrated-windings, fault-tolerant teeth, and the optimal combination of slot and pole numbers, the proposed motor inherently offers negligible electromagnetic coupling between different phase windings, hence, it possesses a fault-tolerant characteristic. Meanwhile, the phase back electromotive force waveforms can be designed to be sinusoidal by employing PMs with a trapezoidal shape, eccentric armature teeth, and unequal tooth widths. The electromagnetic performance is comprehensively investigated and the optimal design is conducted by using the finite-element method.},

PI-Observer, which can also be used as a type of high-gain observer, is successfully applied to estimate unknown inputs of systems. It is known that reasonable estimations of unknown inputs can only be derived assuming perfect knowledge about the model or using high gains in case of uncertain knowledge of the model or the inputs. In the latter case which is considered in this paper, extremely large gains can cause serious problems regarding measurements noise and unmodeled dynamics. In this contribution, an optimization approach to solve the conflict between the quality of the estimation and the sensitivity to the uncertainties is developed for a general class of systems. An elastic beam example is given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Three-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive systems have gotten widely used recently in various applications due to their speed regulation characteristics and high power density. Compared with classical field-oriented control (FOC) and flux-weakening control, model predictive control (MPC) technique is more efficient and effective in achieving excellent performance without complicated controller tuning, but with explicit constraints. Yet, the optimum application of the MPC algorithm in a machine control system is still in the exploratory stage. In order to lower the current and torque ripples, this paper retains a modulator, but replaces all the proportional integrate control loops, which are contained in the conventional FOC systems with a single MPC controller. Moreover, we adopt a brand-new linearization approach to tackle the strong coupled nonlinear IPMSM mathematical model, obtaining an improved linear plant model, which is suitable for the motor with constant load torque. When it comes to flux-weakening control, the requiredd-axis current is calculated, after which it is used as the input of the proposed MPC controller, abandoning the previous natural field weakening method. Finally, for the purpose of lowering the dynamic speed and current overshoot, a further constraint in the change rate of manipulated variables is discussed. The improved control algorithm has been verified in both simulation and experiment.},

Speed encoder, current, and voltage sensors are considered. The DTC and IFOC controllers are properly modified and integrated with the V/f controller in synchronous frame, which allows switching between dc-type voltage commands of different controllers. Therefore, difficult synchronization of different controllers is avoided, and a simple rate limiter is able to achieve smooth handoff transition of different controllers. Details of the DTC, IFOC, and V/f controllers, as well as their integration are presented. Simulation and experimental verification of the proposed FTC are given, where normal abc-frame switching and the proposed synchronous-frame switching of controllers are compared with different switching schemes and at different machine operation conditions.

To achieve high penetration depth of renewable sources into the utility grid, a novel system operation strategy and the corresponding energy management method is proposed. In the operation strategy, the ultracapacitor unit works as the sole voltage source of the micro-grid to support the dc link in both connected and islanding mode. The micro-grid is controlled to deliver/absorb predefined amount of power to/from the utility grid during connected mode and zero during islanding mode. This design will certainly simplify the power dispatching algorithm of the power system and increase the possibility of including large quantities of micro-grids into the utility grid. The energy management method is dedicated to conducting the net power of the micro-grid effectively. The net power is separated into high- and low-frequency components. The high-frequency power is suppressed by the ultracapacitor automatically and the low frequency power is shared by the battery and an adjustment unit. A small-scale dc micro-grid structure with a single dc link is considered for investigation. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results are presented to validate the proposed system operation strategy and the energy management method.},

In this paper, a control method allowing the use of a small size dc-link capacitor for the cascade of voltage controlled-rectifier/inverter-motor drive system is proposed. This is achieved by adding the power balance equation in the system's model and the application of an exact input/output feedback linearization technique in a way that the rectifier controller compensates any sudden change in the inverter load, which is here an induction motor. Since the exact input/output feedback linearization technique is sensitive to the uncertainties over system parameters, a robust control strategy based on sliding mode controller is proposed. By this approach, the dc-link voltage becomes almost insensitive to the load variations. As a result, the level of the dc-link voltage could be stabilized with a small size dc-link capacitor. Without any considerations of the RMS current stress on this dc-link capacitor, a calculation method of a minimum value of this capacitor based on its storage energy is proposed. All the investigations are shown by computer simulations and the performance of controlled system is verified by experimentation results.},

However, the FTC of the three-level T-type converter based shunt active power filter (SAPF) remains limited by redundant devices. To address this problem, an FTC strategy called sequential model predictive tolerant control (SMPTC) is combined with a nonintegral lexicographic optimization (LO) algorithm for solving multiobjective optimization problems. First, the power circuit, space voltage vector diagram, harmonic extraction, and prediction models of the SAPF system are introduced. Second, based on power-switch fault analysis, an adaptive dc bus voltage regulation method is proposed, which ensures that the candidate voltage vectors are fully utilized in the fault state. Third, an LO-SMPTC strategy is proposed by designing a sequential predictive controller that considers the neutral point (NP) voltage and the tracking of the SAPF output current. Compared with the traditional model predictive control, the proposed method not only achieves NP voltage balance and excellent harmonic compensation but also eliminates the selection of weighting factors, thereby improving the control flexibility and time efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of the LO-SMPTC on the dc bus voltage, NP voltage oscillations, grid current power quality, and pole voltage under different scenarios is demonstrated through experiments.},

Another measure that reduces the damage of false alarms is the addition of a sensor reinstatement procedure. This allows us to further tighten the decision threshold to prevent missed detection without compromising the goal of false alarm deterrence. We have demonstrated this virtual sensor system using a vibrating beam structure. The system has been shown to be very robust, giving a 100\% detection rate in all experiments.

The supervision system is able to monitor the health condition of the vehicle and to study the fault recoverability possibilities to reconfigure the control input when a fault occurs. For FD, analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) are derived from the bond graph model. The latter is constraint relations describing the nominal system behavior and is written in terms of the measured system variables. To perform robust FD, adaptive thresholds are generated. They consider modeling and measurement uncertainties. Once a fault is detected, the structural recoverability algorithm analyzes the redundancy presented on the system, and an appropriate control strategy is applied. The designed procedure of FD and FTC is validated by considering a multiple-fault scenario on the vehicle and comparing its results with the nominal case.},

  abstract = {The smart grid features ubiquitous interconnections of power equipments to enable two-way flows of electricity and information for various intelligent power management applications, such as accurate relay protection and timely demand response. To fulfill such pervasive equipment interconnects, a full-fledged communication infrastructure is of great importance in the smart grid. There have been extensive works on disparate layouts of communication infrastructures in the smart grid by surveying feasible wired or wireless communication technologies, such as power line communications and cellular networks. Nevertheless, towards an operable, cost-efficient and backward-compatible communication solution, more comprehensive and practical understandings are still urgently needed regarding communication requirements, applicable protocols, and system performance. Through such comprehensive understandings, we are prone to answer a fundamental question, how to design, implement and integrate communication infrastructures with power systems. In this paper, we address this issue in a case study of a smart grid demonstration project, the Future Renewable Electric Energy Delivery and Management (FREEDM) systems. By investigating communication scenarios, we first clarify communication requirements implied in FREEDM use cases. Then, we adopt a predominant protocol framework, Distributed Network Protocol 3.0 over TCP/IP (DNP3 over TCP/IP), to practically establish connections between electric devices for data exchanges in a small-scale FREEDM system setting, Green Hub. Within the real-setting testbed, we measure the message delivery performance of the DNP3-based communication infrastructure. Our results reveal that diverse timing requirements of message deliveries are arguably primary concerns in a way that dominates viabilities of protocols or schemes in the communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Accordingly, although DNP3 over TCP/IP is widely considered as a smart grid communication solution, it cannot satisfy communication requirements in some time-critical scenarios, such as relay protections, which claim a further optimization on the protocol efficiency of DNP3.},

Three-phase currents are reconstructed by a single current sensor with modification of the inverter topology. The principle of the phase current reconstruction strategy in TPFS inverter is analyzed and the topology of the proposed drive system is illustrated. Then, the normal areas and the dead zones for current reconstruction are investigated in detail, and the vector synthesis method is also explained. Furthermore, the zero vector synthesis strategy and the pulse width modulation (PWM) generation method are also presented, where two current sampling points are applied in each PWM cycle for phase current reconstruction. Finally, an HF voltage injection based sensorless control strategy in the proposed drive system is realized by voltage projection on the proposed k-l axis coordinate system. The reconstructed phase currents track the actual ones accurately, and the estimation error of the rotor position by using the reconstructed phase currents is within {$\pm$}0.1 rad. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation and experimental results on a 5-kW IPMSM prototype.},

The three-phase currents are derived from the single current sensor, and the accuracy uncertainty of the sensor is also considered. The six active vectors are divided into three groups for sensor calibration. Then, the proposed dc-bus current sensor offset error calibration method is implemented by setting two opposite basic vectors together and measuring the current values on both sides of the junction point in a same time interval. If the sum of the two sampled currents is not zero, it indicates that the offset error of the dc-bus current sensor exists. Therefore, a corresponding compensation method is proposed. Meanwhile, the dc-bus current slopes under different switching states are closely related to the rotor position, which are utilized for position sensor error detection. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by experimental results on a 5-kW IPMSM motor prototype.},

The active switching states are arranged at the edge and the center of a PWM cycle. Fixed sampling and simultaneous three-phase currents can be easily achieved with very little hardware and software requirements. A detailed analysis of the effects of nonidealities leads to regional modifications of the switching sequence resulting in almost the whole hexagon as the feasible area.

Firstly, the fault effects analysis is achieved in the abc frame of the IM.

The sensorless drive structure allows avoiding the electromagnetic and vibratory sensitivity of the mechanical sensor, the additional connecting circuits, additional space for the sensor, its price and maintenance requirements. However, in postfault operation mode, the robustness of speed sensorless control strategies has been poorly addressed in the study. Accordingly, this study deals with an experimental study of the robustness and the availability of speed-controlled induction motor (IM) drives without speed sensor in the presence of inverter open-switches faults. For that purpose, a super twisting algorithm-based observer for motor speed estimation is proposed for experimental investigation. Experimental results are performed upon 3-kW IM drive by using dSPACE digital signal processing controller board.

It learns from an examples database comprising sensor recordings, all of which have been classified as corresponding to either the normal behaviour of the system or to one or more fault states. The fault trees generated by IFT are translated into functions in the C programming language. The diagnosis engine links these into a shell program to yield a software system for monitoring and fault diagnosis which has a fast reaction time and is capable of dealing with complicated fault situations. The use of DE/IFT is demonstrated by diagnosing incipient faults in a simulated pneumatic servo-controlled robot arm. Where the sensor recordings it uses are transient responses of the servo system to an input test signal. A variety of different situations are considered including singly occurring faults and multiple simultaneous faults, developing steadily over time or occurring intermittently},

It is important to limit such interferences, since the estimates are: 1) used online to formulate the state feedback controller, and 2) used in the compensation loop, where the estimated overall uncertainty of the system is partially canceled from the original plant. This measurement noise rejection method, which is based on extending the plant model with an additional, integral state variable, allows user to choose higher gains of the observer in order to provide faster convergence of its estimates, without the danger of making the system less energy-effective (or even destabilizing it) due to noise amplification. Experiments, conducted on two laboratory testbeds, show that the considered technique gives satisfactory results in practical application.},

Dynamic behavior and stability analysis of a dc-microgrid with CPLs is presented in this paper. Then, a method to design a fault-tolerant stabilizing system for a dc-microgrid with CPLs is presented. It consists in implementing a local stabilizing agent on each CPL. Then, a method to design the stabilizing system is proposed. The method is based on the definition and resolution of a constrained optimization problem. It permits to consider several fault scenarios, such as the electrical reconfiguration of the dc-microgrid, or the failure of an agent. To illustrate the method's effectiveness, it has been implemented and experimentally tested on a test bed.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a novel fault tolerant voltage control method considering actuator faults and disturbances by using the backstepping control augmented by a new differentiator for islanded microgrids (MGs). Existing voltage control methods are designed based on the ideal condition that the distributed generations' actuators work healthily with the assumption of the absence of faults and disturbances, whereas MGs are exposed to the actuator faults including partial loss of effectiveness and biased faults. The proposed controller robustly regulates the MG voltages irrespective of the actuator faults. In contrast to existing methods, the controller has considered both actuator faults and loads with harmonic/interharmonic currents, which does not need to know the exact model of faults and frequency of harmonic and interharmonic of MG loads. This feature enables the MG to work properly, even at the lowest level, instead of the system completely collapsing. Therefore, it improves the reliability of the MG system. The MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox has verified the validity of the proposed fault tolerant control method. Compared with effective methods, both the theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed method has better, robust, resilient, acceptable, and desirable performance, with respect to the unknown faults, actuator faults, non-linear loads, and disturbances.},

  abstract = {Due to its sturdiness, low cost and ease of implementation, the induction machine is one of the most common electrical motors used in industry. However, this machine still concedes failures leading to unplanned shutdowns, sources of significant financial losses. For this reason, induction machine failure diagnosis has become an ordinary task, where some ameliorations have to be achieved in order to improve the efficiency of maintenance programs by minimizing the number and the time period of unexpected shutdowns. In this paper, we address the recognition of inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) in the stator windings and broken rotor bars (BRBs) in the three-phase squirrel cage induction machine by proposing a new approach. This approach relies on the three-phase current analysis method to extract features and a new hierarchical recognition algorithm based on an ensemble of three different classifiers. In addition, the present work studies the failures recognition of the induction machine operating with a torque and speed control. The proposed approach is a major advanced for the induction machine diagnosis research because it recognizes correctly (detects, localizes and estimates the degree of severity) ITSC and (detects and estimates) BRB faults with an accuracy of 93.36\% and with a great robustness compared to a classical machine learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes new droop control methods for load sharing in a rural area with distributed generation. Highly resistive lines, typical of rural low voltage networks, always create a big challenge for conventional droop control. To overcome the conflict between higher feedback gain for better power sharing and system stability in angle droop, two control methods have been proposed. The first method considers no communication among the distributed generators (DGs) and regulates the converter output voltage and angle ensuring proper sharing of load in a system having strong coupling between real and reactive power due to high line resistance. The second method, based on a smattering of communication, modifies the reference output voltage angle of the DGs depending on the active and reactive power flow in the lines connected to point of common coupling (PCC). It is shown that with the second proposed control method, an economical and minimum communication system can achieve significant improvement in load sharing. The difference in error margin between proposed control schemes and a more costly high bandwidth communication system is small and the later may not be justified considering the increase in cost. The proposed control shows stable operation of the system for a range of operating conditions while ensuring satisfactory load sharing.},

Model reference adaptive system (MRAS) based on reactive power is applied for estimating the rotor speed to make the control scheme speed sensorless. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown by MATLAB/Simulation study. The experimental results in dSPACE-1103 based IM drive further validate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

This paper also presents a method for the cancellation of that error, which could be useful in low-cost shaft-sensorless drives. A combination of two samples' time displacement and the line current pulse-width modulation (PWM) ripple produces a distinctive shape of the reconstructed current error, which is offset jitter like, and is always at the current ripple level. This unusual waveform distortion is often masked by other jitters and noise sources and therefore is typically not given in the relevant literature. However, the distortion is difficult to filter out, and it may be harmful, particularly in applications with low rated motor current. The proposed waveform correction scheme uses the readily available motor states in shaft-sensorless drives and does not require major computational effort. Experimental results show that the scheme recovers the {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$} current waveforms and, as a result, prevent the increase in the sixth harmonic ripple in the d-q currents, which is inherent to the PWM inverter-controlled drives. Consequently, drives with the dc shunt will neither have current signal offset problems nor the need for d-q current signal prefilters with order significantly higher than usual.},

Microgrids can act in isolation or connected to the distribution network. This document presents a preliminary methodology to perform a Diagnosis and Online Failure Mitigation procedure in an experimental microgrid located at the laboratory of the University of Seville. By means of an analytical redundancy relationship, the model and the process are compared in each sampling period; when inconsistencies are detected, residuals are generated in order to proceed with mitigation actions. Once the specific failure has been identified, the controller may be reconfigured to achieve the mitigation of the failure. The implemented optimal control strategy has been Model Predictive Control. Therefore, the mitigation of failures is made by the joint action of the Model Predictive Controller and the Fault Diagnosis System.},

The microgrid communication network should guarantee a complete and bidirectional connectivity among the microgrid resources, a high reliability and a feasible interoperability. This is in a contrast to the current electrical grid structure which is characterized by the lack of connectivity, being a centralized-unidirectional system.

In addition, a guideline for the transition from the current communication systems to the future generation of microgrid communications is provided.

Motivated by the outstanding success of DL-based prediction methods, this article attempts to provide a thorough review from a broad perspective on the state-of-the-art advances of DL in SG systems. Firstly, a bibliometric analysis has been conducted to categorize this review's methodology. Further, we taxonomically delve into the mechanism behind some of the trending DL algorithms.

Finally, challenges and research frontiers are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in the futuristic power grid domain.

The new algorithms for the inverter power device fault detection are derived from the sensed three phase fault currents and their subsequent analytical and logical processing within the micro-computer. The fail-safe action strategy is derived such that the unbalanced three phase fault currents using the dual inverters are quickly restored to balanced three phase currents using a single inverter and hence, theeffect of the vibration of the traction motor due to undesired torque ripple during inverter device fault condition is kept minimum. The proposed new algorithms are verified by suitable simulation and experimental results, and the safe limp-home capability of the DIF-OW-IPMSM drive system is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {A model-based method for interturn short-circuit fault detection and isolation in permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs) is proposed in this paper. The fault detection is realized based on a residual current vector (RCV) generated by the difference between the measured stator currents and the stator currents estimated by a state observer. In order to avoid false alarms due to possible undesired perturbations, the sequence decomposition of the RCV is performed by employing different reference-frames. Thus, the proposed RCV allows the correct detection of interturn short-circuit faults and quantification of the fault severity in any faulty stator-phase winding. Moreover, since the back-EMF generated by the magnets is proportional to the rotor shaft speed, the electrical angular speed is estimated through the stator voltages measurement, without using a speed sensor. Simulation results from the three-phase PMSM dynamic model that allows considering the interturn short-circuit fault in any stator phase-windings are presented. The proposed method is validated using a three-phase PMSM prototype with modified stator windings. The robustness and the reliability of the proposal was tested for several interturn fault conditions under transient conditions including different disturbances.},

  abstract = {Energy crisis and climate change are the major concerns which has led to a significant growth in the renewable energy resources which includes mainly the solar and wind power generation. In smart grid, there is a increase in the penetration level of solar PV and wind power generation. The solar radiation received at the earth surface is greatly dependent on various atmospheric parameters. Forecasting of solar radiation and photovoltaic power is a major concern in terms of efficient integration of solar PV plants in the power grid. There are significant challenges in smart grid energy management due to the variability of large-scale renewable energy generation. Renewable energy forecasting is critical to reduce the uncertainty related to renewable energy generation for a wide range of planning, investment and decision-making purposes. As renewable energy sources are highly intermittent and variable, all the forecasting models available in the literature contain errors. This paper presents an overview of current and new development of weather forecasting such as solar and wind forecasting techniques for renewable energy system in smart grid. Many forecasting models such as physical models, statistical models, artificial intelligence based models, machine learning and deep learning based models were discussed. It is observed that, despite having no clear understanding on atmospheric physics, the artificial intelligence based methods such as machine learning and deep learning method produces reasonable weather forecasting results.},

  abstract = {The presence of phasor measurements in ac systems provides a range of protection techniques based on sequence components and phase comparison to discriminate the fault. However, the absence of phasor measurements in dc system reduces the available alternatives for fault detection. In addition, the presence of low fault tolerant converters, large range of fault impedance and varying grid conditions demands sensitive and selective protection schemes. In this regard, several recent works have suggested a communication-based primary protection due to its high sensitivity to faults. However, with a failure in the communication network, the primary protection will also fail to detect a fault. This paper proposes a backup scheme to isolate the faulty section, even in the case of a communication failure. In the literature, overcurrent- and undervoltage-based backup protection schemes are suggested along with unit primary protection. In the presence of low fault tolerant converters and variable fault resistances, the traditional backup schemes may not work well. This paper proposes a new fault detection method for backup schemes, which utilizes only the locally measured current signal, and uses both derivative and integral characteristics of current to ascertain the occurrence of a fault. The proposed method is capable of detecting the fault accurately and within the required time. The performance of the proposed scheme has been assessed on a {$\pm$} 600 V TN-S grounded dc microgrid under various conditions using hardware-in-loop simulations on real-time digital simulator.},

This paper proposes an improved faults detection, reconstruction and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for motor systems (MS) with typical faults. For this purpose, a sliding mode controller (SMC) with an integral sliding surface is adopted. This controller can make the output of system to track the desired position reference signal in finite-time and obtain a better dynamic response and anti-disturbance performance. But this controller cannot deal directly with total system failures. However an appropriate combination of the adopted SMC and sliding mode observer (SMO), later it is designed to on-line detect and reconstruct the faults and also to give a sensorless control strategy which can achieve tolerance to a wide class of total additive failures. The closed-loop stability is proved, using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results in healthy and faulty conditions confirm the reliability of the suggested framework.},

Based on a nonlinear model, a switching esti mator combined with a two-stage observer structure is proposed. The presented structure is basically a high-gain observer (HGO) to reduce the effects of the uncertainties on the electromagnetic valve actuator model and unmeasurable external disturbances coming from the burning phase of the engine and acting against the actuator movement. The proposed sliding-mode observer has the capability of guaranteeing zero average estimation error in finite time, even in the presence of model uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Considerations on constructive aspects concerning observability are made. Two constructive propositions are proven in this paper to realize the observer. A general comparative analysis is proposed, considering other contributions which use Kalman filters, in which aspects of optimality, robustness, and chattering problems are discussed. In particular, an analysis of the computational effort is also reported. Laboratory experiments of the controlled system, which demonstrate promising behavior, are presented and discussed for exhaust valves of an engine.},

  abstract = {In case of model uncertainty is located in parameters (interval model), an interval observer has been shown to be a suitable strategy to generate an adaptive threshold to be used in residual evaluation. In interval observer-based fault detection methods, the observer gain plays an important role since it determines the minimum detectable fault for a given type of fault and allows enhancing the observer fault detection properties while diminishing model computational drawbacks (i.e. wrapping effect, computational complexity). In this paper, the effect of the observer gain on the time evolution of the residual sensitivity to a fault is analyzed. Then, using these sensitivity studies, the minimum detectable fault time evolution is established. Thus, three types of faults according their detectability time evolution are introduced: permanently (strongly) detected, non-permanently (weakly) detected or just non-detected. Finally, an example based on a mineral grinding- classification process will be used to illustrate the results derived.},

In the proposed FDI scheme, a hybrid architecture is introduced, which is composed of a bank of residual generators and a discrete-event system (DES) fault diagnoser. A novel set of residuals is generated so that a DES fault diagnoser will robustly detect and isolate actuator faults in the system by incorporating an appropriate combination of residuals and their sequential features. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a set of residuals that are used by the DES fault diagnoser are derived based on the non-linear geometric FDI approach. The proposed hybrid FDI scheme is then applied to actuator fault detection and isolation of an almost-lighter-than-air-vehicle. Simulation results presented demonstrate and validate the performance capabilities of the proposed hybrid FDI scheme.},

In the available literature, various multiphase winding layouts have been designed aiming at boosting the machine performance to meet the requirements of the proposed applications. Ultimately, this paper surveyed the state-of-the-art in the available multiphase winding layouts proposed for various innovative applications. Various types of windings were discussed, while investigating their advantages and limitations. This typically considers the winding layouts employed in multiphase induction motors (IMs) and permanent magnet (PM) machines with prime phase and multiple three-phase orders. This study extensively provides innovative winding arrangements that offer better machine characteristics in terms of torque density, efficiency, and fault-tolerance capability. Moreover, the construction of multiphase machines with general n -phase using standard three-phase stator frames has been elaborated. This latter technique obviates the basic necessity of special stator frames with a prime number of phases. Finally, this paper sheds light on the commercial applications that include multiphase winding layouts.},

The processor used in RTU is vulnerable to random faults due to harsh environment around RTUs.

First, a VGPI speed controller is designed. Its simulated performances in speed control and rotor resistance estimation are compared to those of a classical PI controller. Simulation of the IVC induction motor drive using VGPI for speed control shows promising results. The motor reaches the reference speed rapidly and without overshoot, trapezoidal commands under no load are tracked with zero steady state error and almost no overshoot, load disturbances are rapidly rejected and variations of some of the motor parameters are fairly well dealt with. For rotor resistance estimation, the variation of the integrator gain from zero to a terminal value results in the elimination of the transient state estimation error. The proposed VGPI resistance estimator provides excellent tracking performance.},

Most of the existing electrical techniques of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are based on current, voltage, vibration, or/and flux measurements external to the motor. This paper proposes an online fault diagnostic system, which is based on measurements of internal main air gap flux density of an induction motor by an array of Hall effect flux sensors. Such an instrumentation is justified for large specialized induction motors with particularly high-reliability requirements. Fundamental theory behind the air gap flux density as a function of time and space, and its distortions introduced by various faults, is reviewed in this paper. Based on this theory, this paper proposes a comprehensive condition monitoring approach to diagnose induction motor faults including stator turn-to-turn shorts, rotor bar damage, and static and dynamic eccentricity, which may be present individually or at the same time. Moreover, the proposed approach not only detects each fault at its early stage but also determines its exact location and severity. The principles proposed in this paper are illustrated by extensive simulations and are experimentally validated on a prototype online condition monitoring system based on National Instruments real-time platform.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of fault detection under disturbances for multi-input and multi output linear systems is investigated. The considered fault detection approach relies on the recently developed PI observer. A new algorithm is proposed to calculate the gain of the PI observer with the purpose of optimizing the fault detection performance. In the proposed approach, part of the gain matrix is determined by using the system state space model matrices to reduce the disturbance's adverse impacts on the fault detection observer. The rest of the gain matrix is determined by the pole assignment and eigen-structure optimization method. The proposed method is verified by a simulation of a DC Motor.},

The DWT technique plays an important role for signal feature extraction. The abnormal transient signals can be applied to recognize the BRB faults by DWT. The DWT is considered to identify fault features accurately. The dataset is established by feature vectors are applied as input pattern in the training and identification process. Furthermore, the ANFIS is proposed to classify and identify the BRB fault. The fault diagnosis is verified experimentally on 1.5 Hp three phase induction motor under different fault conditions and different load conditions. The experiment results demonstrate that this technique is valid and effective for the BRB faults diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Robotic manipulators are highly nonlinear and coupled systems that are subject to different types of disturbances such as joint frictions, unknown payloads, varying contact points, and unmodeled dynamics. These disturbances, when unaccounted for, adversely affect the performance of the manipulator. Employing a disturbance observer is a common method to reject such disturbances. In addition to disturbance rejection, disturbance observers can be used in force control applications. Recently, research has been done regarding the design of nonlinear disturbance observers (NLDOs) for robotic manipulators. In spite of good results in terms of disturbance tracking, the previously designed nonlinear disturbance observers can merely be used for planar serial manipulators with revolute joints [Chen, W. H., Ballance, D. J., Gawthorp, P. J., O'Reilly, J. (2000). A nonlinear disturbance observer for robotic manipulators. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, 47 (August (4)), 932{\textendash}938; Nikoobin, A., Haghighi, R. (2009). Lyapunov-based nonlinear disturbance observer for serial n-link manipulators. Journal of Intelligent \&amp; Robotic Systems, 55 (July (2{\textendash}3)), 135{\textendash}153]. In this paper, a general systematic approach is proposed to solve the disturbance observer design problem for robotic manipulators without restrictions on the number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), the types of joints, or the manipulator configuration. Moreover, this design method does not need the exact dynamic model of the serial robotic manipulator. This method also unifies the previously proposed linear and nonlinear disturbance observers in a general framework. Simulations are presented for a 4-DOF SCARA manipulator to show the effectiveness of the proposed disturbance observer design method. Experimental results using a PHANToM Omni haptic device further illustrate the effectiveness of the design method.},

  abstract = {In the distributed generation environment, parallel operated inverters play a key role in interfacing renewable energy sources with the grid or forming a grid. This can be achieved by operating the inverters in parallel with an effective control strategy. Hence, qualitative output in terms of voltage and power in a parallel inverter demands a control strategy for abating the certain performance parameters. The technical constraints like load sharing capability, stability, total harmonic distortion, steady state and transient response determines the performance indices of the control strategy in connection with micro grid. The paper presents a comprehensive review of control strategies of parallel inverter based on the communication and control loops. The classification and transfiguration of control strategy from centralized approach to distributed approach and from distributed approach to droop approach were reviewed in the paper. The paper also focuses on the ancillary services that improve the performance indices of the system with multi loop approach of droop control in connection to micro grid. This paper provides an insight of the researcher's perception in emphasizing the power quality issues to achieve regulated and qualitative output with different control strategies. The paper also cites the progress of the research on parallel inverter control by inoculating the issue and the resolution in the literature. This could help the future researchers in addressing the power quality issues associated with parallel inverter control in connection to micro grid. Based on the reviewed state of art, the paper finally reports the suitability and future scope of the control strategy as its concluding remark.},

This solution is based on output feedback since only speed and position of the motor shaft are measured, while current sensors are avoided. This approach is suitable for low cost applications, where the position sensor cannot be removed to guarantee accurate position tracking. The proposed method provides global asymptotic tracking of smooth position and flux references in presence of unknown constant load torque. It is based on the natural passivity of the electromagnetic part of the machine and it guarantees asymptotic decoupling of the induction motor mechanical and electrical subsystems achieving at the same time asymptotic field orientation. Lyapunov analysis and nonlinear control design have been adopted to obtain good position tracking performances and effective torque{\textendash}flux decoupling. The cascaded structure of the controller allows performing a constructive tuning procedure for speed and position control loops. Results of experimental tests are presented to demonstrate the tracking and robustness features of the proposed solution.},

  abstract = {A novel speed sensorless indirect field-oriented control for the full-order model of the induction motor is presented. It provides local exponential tracking of smooth speed and flux amplitude reference signals together with local exponential field orientation, on the basis of stator current measurements only and under assumption of unknown constant load torque. Speed estimation is performed through a reduced-order adaptive observer based on the torque current dynamics, while no flux estimate is required for both observation and control purposes. The absence of the flux model in the proposed algorithm allows for simple and effective time-scale separation between the speed-flux tracking error dynamics (slow subsystem) and the estimation error dynamics (fast subsystem). This property is exploited to obtain a high performance sensorless controller, with features similar to those of standard field-oriented induction motor drives. Moreover, time-scale separation and physically-based decomposition into speed and flux subsystems allow for a simple and constructive tuning procedure. The theoretical analysis based on the singular perturbation method enlightens that a persistency of excitation condition is necessary for the asymptotic stability. From a practical viewpoint, it is related to the well-known observability and instability issues due to a lack of back-emf signal at zero-frequency excitation. A flux reference selection strategy has been developed to guarantee Persistency of excitation in every operating condition. Extensive simulation and experimental tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Configurations for medium- and low-voltage networks are analyzed via optimal power flow analysis by adding voltage regulation and devices capabilities sources in the mathematical formulation. Renewable energy resources such as wind and photovoltaic are considered using typical daily generation curves. Batteries are formulated with a linear representation taking into account operative bounds suggested by manufacturers. Numerical results in two electrical networks with 0.24 kV and 12.66 kV (with radial and meshed configurations) are performed with constant power loads at all the nodes. These simulations confirm that power distribution with DC technology is more efficient regarding energy losses, voltage profiles and greenhouse emissions than its AC counterpart. All the numerical results are tested in the General Algebraic Modeling System widely known as GAMS.},

  abstract = {AbstractObjective: This paper presents a hybrid optimization methodology for the optimal location and sizing of distributed generators (DG) in electrical distribution networks. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP) model for the mathematical formulation, whose objective function is the minimizing of power losses due to the Joule effect in conductors. The constraints we considered include active and reactive power balance, voltage regulation, percentage of penetration of DG into the distribution network, and the total amount of DG allowed in such network.Methodology: To solve the MINLP model, we employed a master-slave strategy that uses the Chu-Beasley genetic algorithm (CBGA) and the optimal power flow (OPF) model as the master and slave algorithms, respectively. This hybrid technique helps reduce the complexity of the MINLP model by eliminating binary variables through the master algorithm and then solving the resulting nonlinear problem (NLP), which corresponds to the OPF model, and uses a classical interior-point method available in MATLAB's fmincon toolbox. Results: We tested the efficiency and robustness of the proposed methodology in 33- and 69-node radial distribution networks. The results show its high performance in terms of power loss reduction and final sizing of DG.Conclusions: The results obtained in the test systems under analysis reveal that there is a direct and proportional relationship between technical losses, the percentage of distributed generation penetration, and the number of generators available. Key words: Chu-Beasley genetic algorithm; distributed generation; hybrid optimization; master-slave algorithm; optimal power flow; radial distribution networks},

The exact nonlinear programming model that represents the economic dispatch problem is transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) model, thereby guaranteeing the global optimal solution-finding due to the conic (i.e., convex) structure of the solution space. The proposed economic dispatch model of the BESS considers the possibility of injecting/absorbing active and reactive power, in turn, enabling the dynamical apparent power compensation in the distribution network. A basic control design based on passivity-based control theory is introduced in order to show the possibility of independently controlling both powers (i.e., active and reactive). The computational validation of the proposed SOCP model in a medium-voltage test feeder composed of 33 nodes demonstrates the efficiency of convex optimization for solving nonlinear programming models via conic approximations. All numerical validations have been carried out in the general algebraic modeling system.},

The three-phase current and wavelet transform is used to identify the state of the system and extracting the current waveform.

This solution is a Energy Management System (EMS) derived from a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) synthesized upon a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) prediction model. This model describes the energy-generation process in both healthy and faulty operation conditions. The MPC is tuned to adequately coordinate the operation of the microgrid, aiming to optimally use its energetic resources, enlarge the renewable generation share and guarantee maximal efficiency and profit, despite the presence of faults (or even failures) in its subsystems. The quantification of the level of faults in the energy system is provided by an extended-state LPV fault estimation observer that works in parallel to the MPC. The proposed EMS, that acts at an hourly rate, finds time-varying control policies, that are passed as energy-generation set-points for the lower-layer subsystems, with respect to operational constraints, internal demands and taking into account the future (estimation) behaviour of the renewables. To validate the proposed fault-tolerant control scheme, a realistic, high-fidelity case study from the Brazilian sugarcane industry is considered. The achieved simulation results assess the effectiveness and qualities of the proposed energy management strategy; an overall good behaviour is exhibited in both faulty and healthy energy-generation conditions.},

Passivity is an important system property and has a central position in control theory. The possibility of rendering a system passive by feedback has been throughly studied and necessary and sufficient conditions for this have been obtained. In this paper it is shown that if a LTI system has an UIO, then it can be rendered strictly dissipative (or passive plus a squared down output) by either output injection or state feedback, if stabilizability is assumed in the last case. Furthermore, these properties are equivalent to a strong detectability property and to the possibility of obtaining an stable inverse of the system, by using only one derivative of the output. This allows an interesting and surprising characterization of the existence of UIO in system terms and sheds also some light into further properties of output injection or feedback passive systems. Lyapunov-like characterizations of these properties can also be given.},

Several works point out some operating regimes where reliable control and speed estimation fail. However, a complete understanding of the nature of these limitations does not exist due to the lack of a formal analysis of the observability properties of this kind of machines. In this paper a method is proposed to make a global analysis of the observability properties of the induction motor under sensorless conditions. The work aims at providing a formal answer to the fundamental question about the existence of indistinguishable internal trajectories for that electric machine. It is shown that there exist diverging trajectories corresponding to the same input/output behavior of the system, i.e. they are indistinguishable from the external signals. This implies the impossibility of constructing an observer that converges for every trajectory of the motor. This indistinguishable trajectories are input dependent, and the system cannot be decomposed into an observable and a non observable part. We give a complete characterization of the set of all indistinguishable trajectories, called indistinguishable dynamics. This description is valid for all values of the parameters.},

This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant control paradigm for a microgrid-connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy system to: 1) achieve ride through during any kind of voltage sag conditions including deep sags and 2) enable the strict satisfaction of recent grid code requirements. The proposed paradigm includes a novel integral terminal sliding mode controller (ITSMC) for the rotor- and grid-side converters along with a series grid-side converter (SGSC) to maintain the voltage levels across the stator windings at their prefault values. A fuzzy logic and a Posicast approach are also proposed to control the SGSC and further improve the performance of the wind energy system. The effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant configuration in riding through different types of grid faults is evaluated via detailed computer experiments. The merits of the proposed approach are further compared to those of the standard state of the art in voltage sag mitigation, namely, the shunt current injection approach and the dynamic voltage restorer. Results clearly show that the proposed control paradigm is able to protect the converters from damages and ensure continuous connection of the WT to the grid during faults, hence maintaining power quality.},

A 3-phase shunt active power filter (SAPF) application has been considered in this work. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: the first one is fault detection, which will be in charge of indicating which phase is faulty in the CHB-nL converter, and the second one is fault isolation. The fault detection stage is implemented by a sliding-mode observer in the {$\alpha$} -{\ss} -coordinates based on an additive modeling perspective of the faults. The isolation stage will identify the exact failing pair of switches within the H-bridge per phase. To achieve fault isolation, proportional-integral observers are proposed to estimate the DC fault profiles. Simulation results using a 3-phase 7-levels CHB (CHB-7L) converter with N=3 bridges are presented to assess the performance of the suggested FDI scheme. Our evaluation includes nominal conditions and a robustness test to step changes on the load side.},

  abstract = {Induction motor powertrains are emerging as a cost-effective option for high-power electric vehicles (EVs). A differential four-wheel drive (D4WD) EV based on two open-end winding induction motor (OEWIM) propulsion is presented in this article. Each OEWIM is driven by two two-level voltage source inverters (VSIs) with two isolated battery packs as the source. The proposed drive control algorithm integrates the uniform state-of-charge (SoC) distribution and fault-tolerant operation. A two-stage lookup table (LUT)-based direct torque control (DTC) scheme is proposed to balance the SoC of batteries by selecting the suitable redundant VSI voltage vectors. The proposed LUT-DTC scheme is less sensitive to variations in motor parameters and provides excellent steady-state and transient performance. The results show the superiority of the proposed controller in terms of battery SoC balancing. The performance of the EV drive with the proposed LUT-DTC is validated by both simulation and laboratory experiments for the FTP75 and HFET driving cycles under different operating modes under normal and fault conditions. The dual-motor-driven D4WD with the proposed LUT-DTC is found to achieve 89.2\% efficiency.},

Constant speed operation through cruise control is achieved using direct torque control (DTC) algorithm. The redundant vectors are used in the switching vector selection of the DTC algorithm to achieve balanced battery currents. Fault-tolerant operation (FTO) of the drive is demonstrated, where the EV will work with full torque even if one of the inverters in rear motor drive or front motor drive or both fail. The dynamic model of the proposed drive is presented. The proposed drive and FTO are verified through simulation as per the FTP-75 driving cycle. An experimental prototype of the proposed drive is developed, and the abovementioned algorithms are verified experimentally as per the FTP-75 and HFET driving cycles. Both the simulation and experimental results are presented, and these results agree with the theoretical observations. Stable operation of EV for the entire test cycle under normal operation, as well as inverter fault conditions, is demonstrated.},

First, a systematic approach to constructing models of multiconverter systems is described. The method generates continuous-time large-signal average models that are suitable for system-level analysis and efficient time-domain simulation. Although the base DAB models are derived using generalized average modeling (GAM), the system-level construction does not require the specification of a base period. Second, a method of reconstructing currents in the high-frequency DAB transformer is proposed. This method significantly improves accuracy in modeling transformer current, which is a critical weakness of DAB models derived using GAM. Furthermore, the method is applied offline as needed, so it does not affect the computational complexity of time-domain simulation. Both the system-level model construction procedure and harmonic reconstruction method are validated in switching simulations and hardware experiments.},

  abstract = {The use of extransportation battery system (i.e., second-life electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle batteries) in grid applications is an emerging field of study. A hybrid battery scheme offers a more practical approach in second-life battery energy storage systems, because battery modules could be from different sources/vehicle manufacturers depending on the second-life supply chain and have different characteristics, e.g., voltage levels, maximum capacity, and also different levels of degradations. Recent research studies have suggested a dc-side modular multilevel converter topology to integrate these hybrid batteries to a grid-tie inverter. Depending on the battery module characteristics, the dc-side modular converter can adopt different modes, such as boost, buck, or boost-buck to suitably transfer the power from the battery to the grid. These modes have different switching techniques, control range, different efficiencies, which give a system designer choice on an operational mode. This paper presents an analysis and comparative study of all the modes of the converter along with their switching performances in detail to understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of each mode to help to select the suitable converter mode. Detailed study of all the converter modes and the thorough experimental results based on a multimodular converter prototype with hybrid batteries have been presented to validate the analysis.},

The electronic differential acquires steering and vehicle speed data before computing the corresponding cornering response for each rear driving wheel using yaw rate prediction from the Ackerman steering geometry. Several series of Excel simulations were done to illustrate neutral steer, understeer and oversteer cornering cases for different cornering radius with varying vehicle speed and the cornering responses for each case was analyzed. This paper will also highlight how on-track testing of Electric Arc can verify the Excel simulation results and consequently determine tire cornering properties.},

The PI controller is tuned depending on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) which is related to the amount of saliency/anisotropy presented in the machine, the amplitude and phase of the incoming modulated carrier signal. Thus, in case any of the mentioned factors changes then the PI has to be retuned again, otherwise it will loose track. In this paper a new PLL structure is suggested to avoid any disturbance that affects the demodulation and detection process. The new PLL scheme is totally independent of any machine parameters except the saliency/anisotropy, which is essential to obtain the rotor speed and position information.},

Thus there are many applications where linear time varying systems naturally arise as the models of system dynamics. There are several formulations of optimal control of linear time-varying systems. For instance, time optimal control is well studied. We formulate an interesting optimal control problem for time varying linear systems. First we consider a discrete time system. The state space description of such discrete time, linear time varying system is given by X (k+1) = A (k) X (k) + B (k) U (k) and Y (k) = C (k) X (k) + D (k) U (k). We consider the case where D (k) = 0 for all 'k'. We consider a multi-input, multi-output linear time varying system. The solution can easily be generalized to Continuous Time Linear Time Varying Systems. Briefly Stochastic version of the problem is discussed.},

It implements a fractional-order sliding mode control (SMC) for the DFIG converters to mitigate the grid faults and ensure robustness against mismatched uncertainties. It also includes a shared reactive power support strategy where both the WECS and PV system participate in providing the necessary reactive current by utilizing their converters as STATCOM. The proposed approach is validated using a wind/PV system installed in a feeder of a test microgrid system subject to short-term unbalanced grid voltage faults and mismatched disturbances. Its performance is further compared to that of a standard SMC-based approach. The obtained results show that the proposed framework improved the dynamic stability of the DC voltage and enabled grid support during both symmetrical and asymmetrical grid faults. Providing fast and robust control of the converters, ensuring compliance with the new grid codes and avoiding the activations of the crowbar system are among the positive features of the proposed framework.},

For a safe and continuous operation of the modern EV, the drive has to acquire robustness features for position sensor failures. Hence, the proposed FTC is based on an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) which continuously estimates both the states and covariance matrices that describe the statistic characters of the system. Under a position sensor failure, the proposed FTC scheme instantly detects sensor fault and reconfigures the traction system with a virtual sensor to provide an EV with a necessary limp home capability. Unlike the conventional EKF with fixed covariance matrices, the proposed AEKF exhibits the robustness to the system stochastic noises and the transient operating conditions. Simulation on MATLAB/Simulink and experimental results on the IPMSM test-bed with a TMS320F28335 DSP under various transient operating conditions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed FTC scheme in comparison to the FTC with the conventional EKF. The comparative results indicate that the proposed AEKF more precisely estimates the rotor position with features robust to the position sensor failures than the conventional EKF.},

A comprehensive and generalized small-signal model of the interconnected autonomous microgrids as a large-scale system is proposed using the interconnection method. The modeling is based on detailed module models to show the impact of each module on the dynamic modes, especially the dominant critical modes. It is generalized and scalable due to separate modeling of modules as well as using unlimited and expandable interconnecting. The proposed interconnection method deals with all electrical and control connections between individual modules including feedback, feed-forward, augmentation, and the order of module inputs and outputs. The model is validated employing Prony analysis method and using output results of an OPAL-RT real-time simulator. Using the proposed modeling method, the small-signal stability analysis and controller design can be realized simply for interconnected microgrids with any number of microgrids and different structures. Typically, for two interconnected microgrids, all dynamic modes and participant state variables in different frequency ranges are identified using the eigenvalue analysis and participation matrix in MATLAB.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of global stabilization of an adaptive observer-based controller design applied to an induction machine (IM) is considered. The IM control usually requires the speed measurement. Formerly, to reject this sensor, an adaptive observer is offered to estimate the rotor speed. Furthermore, a novel control based on the Lyapunov principle is described in order to advance the robust properties of the controller. In fact, the main idea of this control is based on a suitable choice of the voltage control values that guarantee a global stability of the controlled system. The global stability investigation of the closed loop system is described and verified. Simulation results are offered in order to show the performance of the proposed scheme under parametric uncertainties.},

  abstract = {A sensor fault detection and isolation unit is considered for induction-motor drives based on an adaptive observer with rotor-resistance estimation. Generally, closed-loop induction-motor drives with voltage-source inverters use a speed or position, a dc-link voltage, and two or three phase-current sensors. In the proposed fault-detection and isolation unit, the estimated phase currents and rotor resistance are sent to a decision-making unit, which identifies the faulty sensor type based on a deterministic rule base. In the case of a current-sensor failure, it also detects the phase with erroneous sensor output. It is shown that, unlike the other proposed model-based fault-tolerant systems, using a bank of observers is not necessary, and only one current observer with rotor-resistance estimation is sufficient for isolation of all sensors' faults. The accuracy of the proposed approach is analytically proved. Furthermore, extensive simulation and experimental tests verify the effectiveness of the proposed method at different operating conditions.},

The novelty of this scheme consists in the synthesis of a new structure of proportional-integral observer (PIO) reformulated from the new linear ARX-Laguerre representation with filters on system input and output in order to estimate the unknown inputs presented as faults. The designed observer exploits the input/output measurements to reconstruct the Laguerre filter outputs where the stability and the convergence properties are ensured by using Linear Matrix Inequality. However, a significant reduction of this model is subject to an optimal choice of both Laguerre poles which is achieved by a new proposed identification approach based on a genetic algorithm. The performances of the proposed identification approach and the resulting PIO are tested on numerical simulation and validated on a 2ndorder electrical linear system.},

The occurrence of any sensor fault in the DC microgrid should be detected immediately by the fault detection network to achieve an overall stable performance of the system. This work focuses on sensor fault diagnosis of voltage and current sensors in interconnected DGUs of the microgrid. Two separate higher order sliding mode observers (HOSM) based on model dynamics are designed to estimate the voltage and current and generate the residuals for detecting the faulty sensors in DGUs. Multiplicative single and multiple sensor faults are considered in voltage and current sensors. By appropriate selection of threshold, single and multiple sensor fault detection strategies are formulated. A hierarchical controller is designed to ensure equal sharing of current among the DGUs of the DC microgrid and stabilize the system. Simulations are performed to validate the proposed approach for various configurations of the DC microgrid under various load and off noise conditions.},

Abrupt, incipient, and intermittent sensor faults can cause the complete blackout of the system if left undetected. In this research, we examined the observer-based residual analysis via index-based approaches for fault detection of multiple sensors in a healthy drive. Seven main indices including the moving mean, average, root mean square, energy, variance, first-order derivative, second-order derivative, and auto-correlation-based index were employed and analyzed for sensor fault diagnosis. In addition, an auxiliary index was computed to differentiate a faulty sensor from a non-faulty one. These index-based methods were utilized for further analysis of sensor fault detection operating under a range of various loads, varying speeds, and fault severity levels. The simulation results on a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) are provided to demonstrate the pros and cons of various index-based methods for various fault detection scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed predictive secondary control strategy to share imbalance in three-phase, three-wire isolated AC Microgrids. The control is based on a novel approach where the imbalance sharing among distributed generators is controlled through the control of single-phase reactive power. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is the inclusion of an objective function and dynamic models as constraints in the formulation. The controller relies on local measurements and information from neighboring distributed generators, and it performs the desired control action based on a constrained cost function minimization. The proposed distributed model predictive control scheme has several advantages over solutions based on virtual impedance loops or based on the inclusion of extra power converters for managing single-phase reactive power among distributed generators. In fact, with the proposed technique the sharing of imbalance is performed directly in terms of single-phase reactive power and without the need for adding extra power converters into the microgrid. Contrary to almost all reported works in this area, the proposed approach enables the control of various microgrid parameters within predefined bands, providing a more flexible control system. Extensive simulation and Hardware in the Loop studies verify the performance of the proposed control scheme. Moreover, the controller's scalability and a comparison study, in terms of performance, with the virtual impedance approach were carried out.},

The detection mechanism is based on the separation between the computed invariant sets and 'transition' sets where appropriate residual variables 'jump' when faults occur. The closed-loop system is then reconfigured by means of a virtual sensor which is adapted to the detected fault. Furthermore, conditions are derived in terms of bounds on reference signals, noise and disturbances which guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under the resulting fault tolerant control scheme for all considered fault situations. Simulation results of the proposed scheme on a longitudinal car following scenario and experimental results on a laboratory scale magnetic levitation system confirm the validity of the approach under realistic conditions.},

Management of BEV charging requires coordination and communication between various mobility and energy entities. Communication protocols provide a set of rules and guidelines to facilitate the communication and data exchange between two or more entities to ensure successful charging demand management and electricity grid integration of BEVs. A key challenge is that companies are currently developing and implementing several proprietary protocols to manage BEV charging, which could risk losing or vastly under-utilising BEV charging demand flexibility, and consequently hindering proper grid integration. This work presents the status quo on communication protocols and standards for vehicle grid integration and it is targeted for industries and governments. The objectives of the work are to review current protocols, present some of the advantages of open protocols, identify challenges and additional efforts required to develop, implement, and standardise these protocols to ensure that charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is synergistic with the operation of the electricity system.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel X-by-wire unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)-unmanned ground carrier (UGC). To show functions of the UGV, the mechanisms and design processes of the key subsystems are described, especially the in-wheel motor-driven and independent steer subsystems. As an all-wheel-independently steered (AWIS) UGV, the UGC is able to achieve the diagonal move steer mode (DMSM) to improve the maneuverability significantly. To improve the path tracking performance in DMSM, a robust H2/H{$\infty$} chassis yaw controller is proposed, which uses the additional yaw moment provided by in-wheel motors to track the desired sideslip angle and avoid the yaw motion. The energy to peak and energy to energy performance of the sideslip angle and the yaw velocity are considered and handled by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach during the H2/H{$\infty$} controller design. The parametric uncertainties and disturbances of the vehicle mass, the yaw inertia, and tire cornering stiffness are considered to improve the robustness. Finally, the step steer and lane change tests are conducted with the UGV testbed to validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed chassis controller.},

Nevertheless, studies in this area have been normally focused on sensored machine drives. This research focuses on the FTC approach for Y-connected Three-Phase Induction Motor (TPIM) drives without speed measurement. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Rotor Field Oriented Control (RFOC) system are developed in order to control sensorless speed controlled Y-connected TPIM during both healthy and Single Phase Open-Circuit Fault (SPOCF) conditions. Unlike the conventional sensorless control system, the proposed drive system can be used for the sensorless speed controlled Y-connected TPIM during both normal and SPOCF conditions. The performances of the proposed FTC scheme are implemented on a DSP/TMS320F28335 controller board for a 0.75\,kW Y-connected TPIM drive system. Different experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness and possibility of the introduced technique.},

  abstract = {Background 3{$\phi$} Induction Machine (IM) drives are broadly used in different industrial applications. During failure conditions, 3{$\phi$} IM drive systems cannot continue its optimal performance. Aims The present study presents a method for indirect rotor field-orientated control (IRFOC) of star-connected 3{$\phi$} IM drives during open-phase failure (OPF) condition. In addition, in this study the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to determine the coefficients of proportional-integral (PI) controllers in the OPF mode. Materials \& Methods In the proposed method, two unbalanced currents and voltage rotational matrices are utilized to change the asymmetrical structure of the faulty 3{$\phi$} IM equations to the equations with a symmetrical structure. Using these matrices, the speed control of the faulty 3{$\phi$} IM can be realized with minor changes in the conventional IRFOC structure including control parameters, transformation matrices, and coefficients of PI controllers. Results Experimental results were presented during various operating conditions on a 1 HP star-connected 3{$\phi$} IM drive system. Discussion The experimental tests in different operating conditions showed good performances of the proposed control system during both the steady-state and the transient periods. Conclusion The proposed control method exhibited a significant improvement in reducing the speed, torque, and flux oscillations, compared to the standard IRFOC system during OPF. In addition, the results obtained from the comparison between the proposed vector control method with and without the optimized coefficients of PI controllers indicated the effect of the optimization of PI controllers in the proposed IRFOC system for the 3{$\phi$} IM drive during OPF.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel scheme of demagnetization monitoring and life extending control for traction systems driven by permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Firstly, the offline training is carried to evaluate fatigue damage of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) under different flux loss based on first-principle modeling. Then an optimal control law can be extracted by turning down the power distribution factor of the demagnetizing PMSM until all damages of IGBTs turn to balance. Next, the similarity-based empirical modeling is employed to online estimate remaining flux of PMSMs, which is used to update the power distribution factor by referring the optimal control law for the health-oriented autonomous control. The proposed strategy can be demonstrated by a case study of traction drive system coupled with dual-PMSMs. Compared with traditional control strategy, the results show that the novel scheme can not only guarantee traction performance but also extend remaining useful life (RUL) of the system after suffering demagnetization fault.},

  abstract = {In recent years, due to the wide utilization of direct current (DC) power sources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells, different DC loads, high-level integration of different energy storage systems such as batteries, supercapacitors, DC microgrids have been gaining more importance. Furthermore, unlike conventional AC systems, DC microgrids do not have issues such as synchronization, harmonics, reactive power control, and frequency control. However, the incorporation of different distributed generators, such as PV, wind, fuel cell, loads, and energy storage devices in the common DC bus complicates the control of DC bus voltage as well as the power-sharing. In order to ensure the secure and safe operation of DC microgrids, different control techniques, such as centralized, decentralized, distributed, multilevel, and hierarchical control, are presented. The optimal planning of DC microgrids has an impact on operation and control algorithms; thus, coordination among them is required. A detailed review of the planning, operation, and control of DC microgrids is missing in the existing literature. Thus, this article documents developments in the planning, operation, and control of DC microgrids covered in research in the past 15 years. DC microgrid planning, operation, and control challenges and opportunities are discussed. Different planning, control, and operation methods are well documented with their advantages and disadvantages to provide an excellent foundation for industry personnel and researchers. Power-sharing and energy management operation, control, and planning issues are summarized for both grid-connected and islanded DC microgrids. Also, key research areas in DC microgrid planning, operation, and control are identified to adopt cutting-edge technologies. This review explicitly helps readers understand existing developments on DC microgrid planning, operation, and control as well as identify the need for additional research in order to further contribute to the topic.},

The proposed low-order dynamic controller inherently has low-pass filter property in which the effect of differentiators can be obtained. Using singular perturbation theory, the authors show that the system state is finally constrained in a small bound region when the gain is high enough. Finally, a numerical example is explained for demonstrating the applicability of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Various torque distribution and stability control algorithms have been studied along with the development of four-wheel drive vehicles. But, most of those algorithms focus only on performance improvement. Since the independent four-wheel drive system is based on four drive motors, faults can occur in a motor or an inverter. If a fault occurs, the vehicle stability is not guaranteed and a fatal accident can occur. In this study, the fault-tolerant stability control algorithm for remaining healthy motors is proposed. This fault-tolerant control (FTC) system contains torque distribution and stability control algorithms. For accurate control of motor allocation, driving conditions such as under/over-steering, and steering direction should be considered, as well as vehicle condition such as fault motor location and motor performance limits. The proposed FTC is evaluated with two fault conditions (e.g., front motor fault, rear motor fault) under straight acceleration and constant steering acceleration scenarios. The behavior characteristics and driving risks caused by failures of motors while driving are analyzed. Also, the FTC algorithm is accurately follow a desired path within a minimum error range that the driver can cover.},

We introduce a receiver structure with joint blind decision feedback equalizer (DFE) loop, timing recovery loop, carrier recovery loop and AGC loop. The architecture of blind dual mode DFE, with constant modulus algorithm (CMA) initialization block, dual mode feed-forward filter and feedback filter, operates in the passband so that equalizer can be adjusted completely independent of carrier phase. For VLSI realization, the hybrid form, one of pipelined structure without introducing extra latency is applied to the DTE. The all digital synchronization loops such as timing recovery are also described. The timing recovery architecture features with recirculating decimator for variable rate interpolation that allows it operate at any user specified symbol rate from 875kbaud to 7Mbaud. The SPW HDS{\texttrademark} simulation and Xilinx VirtexTM-II 3000 FPGA verification confirm that proposed scheme is robust against non-impulse noise, multi-paths and carrier error such as frequency offset, phase offset and phase jitter.},

This paper proposes an optimal management system for microgrids, including distributed generations and electric vehicles, to decrease operational costs and environmental emissions. In the proposed system, the performance of electric vehicles in both gasoline and electric modes is considered. Moreover, their response and involvement in energy management and their effect on cost and emission have been investigated. The total cost of generated power and battery life reduction in electric vehicles is considered an influential and limiting factor in the proposed structure. The proposed design is simulated on a sample grid in two different modes, with and without considering demand response. Each mode includes five different scenarios. Simulation results show that the optimal management of electric vehicles and distributed generations would reduce generation costs and emissions. Using demand response in the examined grid has also reduced the total cost by about 6\%. The maximum and minimum cost reductions were about 8\% and 3\%, respectively. CO2 and NOx generation rates were decreased by 74\% and 93\%, respectively. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method could reduce costs and environmental pollutants.},

On the other hand, in parallel form a single module is employed for FDI purposes, simultaneously. In other words, two separate multiple-classifiers schemes are presented by using fourteen various statistical and non-statistical classification schemes. Furthermore, in this study, a novel ensemble classification scheme namely blended learning (BL) is proposed for the first time where single and boosted classifiers are blended as the local classifiers in order to enrich the classification performance. Single-classifier schemes are also exploited in FDI modules along with the ensemble-classifier methods for comparison purposes. In order to show the performance of proposed FDI method, it was also tested and validated on DAMADICS actuator system benchmark. Besides, comparative study with the related works done on this benchmark is provided to show the pros and cons of the proposed FDI method.},

Using this platform, two different types of energy storage market models are proposed to promote local-level (within the microgrid) and communal- or global-level ESSs' participation in the intra- and intermicrogrid TE markets. Also, a reinforcement learning algorithm known as simulated-annealing-based Q-learning is used to develop bidding strategies for ESSs to participate in the TE markets. Besides energy trading, the proposed system also accounts for the losses caused by energy transactions between ESSs and microgrids using a complex current-tracing-based loss allocation method. The overall efficacy of the proposed energy market management system is demonstrated using a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system with multiple microgrids and ESSs. Based on simulation results, it is observed that the proposed model can effectively reinforce the balance between the supply and the demand in the microgrids using the mix of local and global ESSs.},

  abstract = {This work proposes fault-tolerant schemes for open-transistor faults applied to three-phase dual active bridge converters (TPDABC), using different transformers: star-star, delta-delta, and delta-star. The proposal consists of operating the TPDABC as a single-phase dual active bridge converter, modifying the modulation strategy. This strategy avoids the need for additional components, which allows the converter to continue operating after an event of open transistor failure. The expressions of the average power when the converter operates in the fault-tolerant modes are determined. The analysis determines that the maximum power that can be transferred using the transformer delta-star is larger than the power obtained for star-star and delta-delta connections. Simulation results allow the proposed schemes to be validated.},

The proposed control strategy is developed in the discrete-time dq0-reference frame. It has an inner current loop to control the inductors currents and an outer voltage control loop. The analysis of this paper demonstrates that using conventional controllers, the voltages of d and q axes can be decoupled, into the whole operating range, which allows the outer voltage controllers to be designed as independent SISO systems, meeting the requirements of the transient and permanent regimes imposed by Standards. To improve the performance when the inverter feeds unbalanced loads, this paper proposes to use a Proportional-Resonant controller only in the inner loop of the axis 0, achieving a simple control strategy and, consequently with a low computational cost. Simulation and experimental results allow validating the proposed control strategy.},

The implementation of a curved switching surface for DAB converters is a new area of research undertaken in this paper. The proposed technique brings the benefit of unprecedented dynamic performance, already developed for nonisolated topologies (e.g., buck and boost), to this more complex isolated topology. The analysis provides insight into the natural trajectories of the DAB converters and creates an accurate framework in the normalized geometrical domain. As a result, the physical limits of the converter under study become evident. Those physical limits are exploited by employing the NSS to obtain fast transient response under start-up, sudden load transients, and reference change. In addition, fixed-frequency operation is one of the key features of the proposed control scheme, which allows optimizing the design of the high-frequency transformer. Experimental results are presented to validate the NSS for DAB converters and illustrate the benefits of the normalization technique.},

This motor drive is suitable, especially for large-capacity fan-/blower-like loads, the torque of which is proportional to a square of the motor mechanical speed.

Although the motor drive has no speed sensor attached to the motor shaft, this method makes a slow startup stable with the help of a stator-current feedback loop.

The proposed controller consists of a Lyapunov-based hybrid model predictive control based on mixed logical dynamical (MLD) framework. The main contribution of the proposed technique is the assurance of the closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility, by a novel approach focused on MLD models, using ellipsoidal terminal constraints and the Lyapunov decreasing condition.

A comprehensive finite-horizon scheduling optimization model is formulated to optimally control the operation of the NGIM, which integrates both forecasts and newly updated information collected from the available sensors at the network level. The model can be implemented as a supervisory control and energy management system for the NGIM to manipulate the indoor climate and optimize the crop production. The cooperation is reached through a bidirectional communication infrastructure, where a master central controller is available at the network level and is in charge of coordinating and managing various control signals. An MPC-based algorithm is used for the future operation scheduling of all subsystems available in the NGIM. The MPC strategy is tested through a case study where the influences of climate data on the operation of the NGIM are analyzed via numerical results.},

The system studied is a double star induction machine (DSIM) controlled by a robust control called Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC). The proposed method makes it possible to detect, isolate, and reconfigure the fault in real time. The reconfiguration is based on the comparison between the values measured by the current sensors and the estimated values. Two voltage observers will be used to estimate the estimated currents, and these two observers are placed at the level of the converters. This method of fault-tolerant control (FTC) has the advantage of ensuring, even in the presence of a sensor fault, the continuity of the system's operation and maintaining its performance at the desired level. The effectiveness of the FTC strategy proposed in this work is illustrated with simulations carried out under the MATLAB/Simulink environment.},

This initiative has made significant progress toward the modernization and growth of the electric utility infrastructure and aims to integrate it into today's advanced communication era, both in function and in architecture. The study is focused on the difference between a conventional grid and a smart grid concept and the integration of renewable energy in a smart grid system where grid control is a must for energy management.

The method uses the stator voltage as state variable but eliminates the voltage transducers. Traditional MRAS methods use two sets of equations to estimate the motor speed. However, the proposed system utilizes the q-axis current regulator proportional{\textendash}integral (PI) control output \$\$ {\textbackslash}left( \{V\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sq\}\}\^\{*\} \} {\textbackslash}right) \$\$in the reference model as a new Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) technique and compares this value with the estimated voltage \$\$ {\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}hat\{V\}\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sq\}\} \} {\textbackslash}right) \$\$in an adaptive model. The method calculates the steady-state q-axis stator voltage in adaptive model, so, the calculation burden in the estimation loop is significantly reduced. Choosing the q-axis stator voltage as state variable removes requirement of the rotor parameters in calculations, and therefore, the system becomes resistant to the alteration in rotor parameters. Furthermore, the mentioned special calculation ensures the elimination of the need for flux estimation, so the speed estimation technique becomes resistant to integral and derivative calculation-based problems. The MATLAB/Simulink simulation results and experiments under various operation conditions verifies the effectiveness of the studied technique.},

The proposed EMS is implemented for a microgrid composed of photovoltaic panels, two wind turbines, a diesel generator and an energy storage system. A coherent forecast information scheme and an economic comparison framework between the RH and the standard unit commitment (UC) are proposed. Solar and wind energy forecasting are based on phenomenological models with updated data. A neural network for two-day-ahead electric consumption forecasting is also designed. The system is tested using real data sets from an existent microgrid in Chile (ESUSCON). The results based on different operation conditions show the economic sense of the proposal. A full practical implementation of the system for ESUSCON is envisioned.},

  abstract = {Cloud applications are often subject to unexpected events like flashcrowds and hardware failures. Users that expect a predictable behavior may abandon an unresponsive application when these events occur. Researchers and engineers addressed this problem on two separate fronts: first, they introduced replicas {\textendash} copies of the application with the same functionality {\textendash} for redundancy and scalability; second, they added a self-adaptive feature called brownout inside cloud applications to bound response times by modulating user experience. The presence of multiple replicas requires a dedicated component to direct incoming traffic: a load-balancer. Existing load-balancing strategies based on response times interfere with the response time controller developed for brownout-compliant applications. In fact, the brownout approach bounds response times using a control action. Hence, the response time, that was used to aid load-balancing decision, is not a good indicator of how well a replica is performing. To fix this issue, this paper reviews some proposal for brownout-aware load-balancing and provides a comprehensive experimental evaluation that compares them. To provide formal guarantees on the load-balancing performance, we use a randomized optimization approach and apply the scenario theory. We perform an extensive set of experiments on a real machine, extending the popular lighttpd web server and load-balancer, and obtaining a production-ready implementation. Experimental results show an improvement of the user experience over Shortest Queue First (SQF){\textemdash}believed to be near-optimal in the non-adaptive case. The improved user experience is obtained preserving the response time predictability.},

The information provided by these sensors, together with the pulse width modulation (PWM) information, is used to reconstruct the motor phase currents. After a description of the two methods and the limitations they present, an application in case of an induction motor drive is illustrated in which the adjacent vector-space vector pulse width modulation (AV-SVPWM) technique is used to drive the inverter. Some aspects involving the non ideal behaviour of different parts of the system (presence of dead time, power switches driver delay, rise and settling time of the current, A/D conversion module sampling time) are investigated in details and the specific hardware implementation is discussed. Experimental results and comparisons between the two methods are presented.},

  abstract = {To reduce the cost of the inverter system in home appliances, a method using a shunt resistor at the DC-link can be substituted for a method using two current sensors at the inverter output. However, the minimum time of the active vector is required to sample the accurate current using a 1-shunt resistor. Therefore, many studies have been conducted investigating current reconstruction methods in the unmeasurable region of the current. The conventional methods using voltage injection have some problems such as high THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) and acoustic noise, because the PWM pattern is shifted. In addition, the current reconstruction is inaccurate in a low modulation region. In this paper, the cause of the noise in conventional methods is analyzed and a simple current reconstruction method based on an average current estimation and a current reference is utilized for reducing acoustic noise. In an immeasurable area, especially a low modulation region, an intermittent PWM shift method is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the reconstructed current. Therefore, a control strategy that combines all of the mentioned methods is implemented for the entire operating range. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified through the experimental results and the results of sound measurement in an anechoic chamber are included to compare with the acoustic noise.},

Such a condition is often required for the existence of a UIO. To circumvent the restriction imposed by the observer matching condition, auxiliary outputs defined as the higher-order derivatives of the output measurements are introduced so that the observer matching condition is satisfied with respect to unknown inputs. The augmented outputs consisting of both the output measurements and the auxiliary outputs are defined, where the auxiliary outputs are estimated using higher-order sliding-mode exact differentiators based on the output measurements. Through suitable coordinate transformations, a system with the augmented outputs can be partitioned into two interconnected subsystems: an unknown input-free subsystem and an unknown input-dependent subsystem. The state vectors of the second subsystem are described in terms of augmented outputs. The unknown input-free subsystem is then used to design a UIO for estimation of the state vector. The performance of the UIO is verified through simulated numerical examples.},

In this method, the received 16-QAM signal is processed in two paths; one path transforms the received signal into a 12-PSK signal, and the other detects the envelope of the received signal. Using an envelope detector and a window detector, we extract the time period that the 16-QAM signal causing phase jitter exists. We recover the carrier phase from the 12-PSK signal using a digital phase locked loop (PLL) which is controlled by the window detector output. By this method, the data pattern-related noise of the conventional times-four carrier recovery method is entirely eliminated. We implement an experimental model to examine the proposed method},

  abstract = {The design of optimal input for fault identification in electric ground vehicles (EGV) that use four independent In-Wheel Motors (IWM) and four-wheel steering (4WS) is presented in this paper. As the number of motors and steering actuators increases beyond the number of controlled variables, an EGV becomes an over-actuated system, which provides actuator redundancy and possibility of the fault tolerant control in case faults that occur in vehicle elements, such as its sensors and actuators. To ensure the reliability of the EGV during driving, on-line fault identification is needed and its performance is directly dependent on the input signals. The input can be designed using the control allocation method, which is one approach to manage actuator redundancy. The proposed control allocation maximizes the sensitivity of the system output to parameters related to the fault position, while the system output is controlled simultaneously to maintain stability and follow the desired vehicle motions, even when faults occur. Simulations using the commercial software CarSim{\textregistered} are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimal input design method for fault identification; the performance of the system is compared to the conventional white noise perturbation input with equal power.},

  abstract = {A method for achieving open-phase fault tolerant operation of a dual-inverter-based traction drive with charging capability is presented. This method utilises a contactor to connect the switching nodes of the two half bridges which are normally used for AC charging in this dual inverter configuration. These half bridges are then modulated to provide a path for zero-sequence current and enhance the available voltage vector space of the drive by injecting a controllable common-mode voltage between the two inverters. A control method and five-level modulator based on zero-sequence voltage control and phase shifted carriers are introduced to accommodate this novel remedial method. Using this approach, the open-phase faulted dual inverter drive is able to operate with twice the speed range of the conventional open-phase fault tolerant approach, which is to provide a path for zero-sequence current by connecting the negative DC rails of the two inverters with a contactor. Simulation and experimental results with a prototype dual inverter drive are presented to validate the theory of the new control and modulation method. The experimental results showcase the proposed algorithms performance by dynamically responding to an open-phase fault and starting from standstill, thereby proving its validity for an electric vehicle application.},

Induction motor (IM), surface-mounted permanent-magnet (PM) (SPM), and interior PM (IPM) synchronous motor drives are investigated, with reference to a common vehicle specification. The IM is penalized by the cage loss, but it is less expensive and inherently safe in case of inverter unwilled turnoff due to natural de-excitation. The SPM motor has a simple construction and shorter end connections, but it is penalized by eddy-current loss at high speed, has a very limited transient overload power, and has a high uncontrolled generator voltage. The IPM motor shows the better performance compromise, but it might be more complicated to be manufactured. Analytical relationships are first introduced and then validated on three example designs and finite element calculated, accounting for core saturation, harmonic losses, the effects of skewing, and operating temperature. The merits and limitations of the three solutions are quantified comprehensively and summarized by the calculation of the energy consumption over the standard New European Driving Cycle.},

After the brief introduction of grid-connected converters, this article explores stability challenges of PEDSs, especially on the low inertia issue and multitimescale characteristics, as well as the dynamics when connected to weak grids. The low inertia issue is considered as one of great challenges that power electronics introduce to the conventional power grid. Accordingly, the stability issues of PEDSs are discussed. The exploration reveals that the multitimescale coupling among various control loops and the mutual effects of multiple converters demand much more attention than ever before. The coordinated control of converters for the global stability of PEDSs is also summarized, part of which offers the possibility to solve the inertia problem. This article serves as an inspiration on potential solutions to these issues. In order to provide a more intuitive impression of the inertia problem in PEDSs, a case study is exemplified to highlight the analysis and discussion.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}To efficiently operate electromechanical systems powered by two energy sources, it is necessary to determine the instantaneous power split between sources in order to minimize the energy consumption of the whole system. In this work, this problem is posed as a nonlinear finite horizon optimal control problem with control and state constraints and is solved using a direct transcription approach. The problem is fully discretized in time and the resulting finite dimensional optimization problem is solved using a nonlinear programming code. This paper describes the application of direct transcription to the case of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) being developed in the Applied Electronics Group (GEA) at the University of R{\'i}o Cuarto. The statement and discretization of the control problem, the setting for using the nonlinear programming code and several examples and comparisons with those obtained by other approaches are described.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The approach does not contain any feedback loop and is therefore highly tolerant against laser phase noise. This is crucial, especially for higher order QAM constellations, which inherently have a smaller phase noise tolerance due to the lower spacing between adjacent constellation points. In addition to the mathematical description of the proposed carrier recovery algorithm also a possible hardware-efficient implementation in a parallelized system is presented and the performance of the algorithm is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations for square 4-QAM (QPSK), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. For the simulations ASE noise and laser phase noise are considered as well as analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and internal resolution effects. For a 1 dB penalty at BER = 10-3, linewidth times symbol duration products of 4.1 x 10-4 (4-QAM), 1.4 x 10-4 (16-QAM), 4.0 x 10-5 (64-QAM) and 8.0 x 10-6 (256-QAM) are tolerable.},

The main task of an energy flow management unit is to split the instantaneous vehicle power demand between the internal combustion engine and the electric motor ensuring that the power sources are operated at high efficiency operating points and the related vehicle emissions are minimised. This paper presents an original methodology for the tuning of the characteristic parameters. The proposed methodology identifies, using the genetic algorithm, the value of the energy flow management parameters that minimize the cost function in terms of fuel consumption and emissions. Some interesting simulation results are discussed to prove the validity of the methodology, which contributes to a substantial reduction of the pollutant emissions from hybrid electric vehicles.},

Microgrids are attracting a great deal of attention since they integrate distributed generation in the main grid reliably and cleanly. When designing the control system of a microgrid, several functions must be considered, such as the management of electrical and thermal energy, load management, synchronisation with the main grid, etc. Both companies and institutions have carried out research into the control of microgrids over recent years and many proposals can be found in the literature. Thus, the design of the control system of a microgrid is a complex task due to its multiple functions and the large number of proposed solutions. This paper presents a complete description of the main features of a microgrid and describes the characteristics of the control systems used. Details are provided of the control tasks involved and of the main types of controls proposed in the literature.

  abstract = {Choice of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in transportation systems is becoming more prominent for optimized energy consumption. HEVs are attaining tremendous appreciation due to their eco-friendly performance and assistance in smart grid notion. The variation of energy storage systems in HEV (such as batteries, supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, fuel cells, and so on) with numerous control strategies create variation in HEV types. Therefore, choosing an appropriate control strategy for HEV applications becomes complicated. This paper reflects a comprehensive review of the imperative information of energy storage systems related to HEVs and procurable optimization topologies based on various control strategies and vehicle technologies. The research work classifies different control strategies considering four configurations: fuel cell-battery, battery-ultracapacitor, fuel cell-ultracapacitor, and battery-fuel cell- ultracapacitor. Relative analysis among different control techniques is carried out based on the control aspects and operating conditions to illustrate these techniques' pros and cons. A parametric comparison and a cross-comparison are provided for different hybrid configurations to present a comparative study based on dynamic performance, battery lifetime, energy efficiency, fuel consumption, emission, robustness, and so on. The study also analyzes the experimental platform, the amelioration of driving cycles, mathematical models of each control technique to demonstrate the reliability in practical applications. The presented recapitulation is believed to be a reliable base for the researchers, policymakers, and influencers who continuously develop HEVs with energy-efficient control strategies.},

This is due to its ability to avoid eventual wrong diagnostics of the conventional motor current signature analysis in certain industrial situations (presence of load toque oscillations, light loading conditions, and so on). However, the application of these transient methodologies requires the use of advanced signal processing tools. This paper presents a detailed comparison between the two main groups of transforms that are employed in transient analysis: discrete and continuous. This paper does not focus on trivial fault cases but on difficult real situations where the application of the conventional methods often leads to false diagnostics (outer bar breakages in double-cage motors, motors with rotor axial duct influence, and combined faults). Indeed, it is the first time that continuous tools are applied to some of these controversial situations. The results in this paper prove the special advantages of the continuous transforms, tearing down some false myths about their use.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for designing a virtual sensor in the case of Fault Tolerant Control. The whole approach, described in the paper, is applied to a winding machine. The process is modelled by a Linear Time Varying (LTV) model. The control of the web tension is based on the estimated or virtual measurements as feedback variables. The main contribution concerns the design of an accurate bank of observers able to both isolate and estimate sensor faults while preserving the system's integrity in terms of structure and performances. The objective of Active Fault Tolerant Control System, is to maintain current performances close to desirable ones and preserve stability conditions when faults occur. The presented method allows one to isolate and to estimate sensor faults. The effectiveness and performances of the strategy are illustrated on the winding machine in the case of a complete loss of sensor.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the characterisation of the minimum detectable fault (MDF) by means of residual sensitivity integrated with the set-invariance theory when using an interval observer-based approach as a fault detection (FD) scheme. Uncertainties (disturbances and noise) are considered as of unknown but bounded nature (i.e. in the set-membership framework). A zonotopic-set representation towards reducing set operations to simple matrix calculations is utilised to bound the state/output estimations provided by the interval observer-based approach. In order to show the connection between sensitivity and set-invariance analyses, mathematical expressions of the MDF are derived when considering different types of faults. Finally, a simulation case study based on a quadruple-tank system is employed to both illustrate and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The interval observer-based FD scheme is used to test the MDF obtained from the integration of both residual sensitivity analysis and set-invariance theory in the considered case study.},

The approach is based on a coherent framework of control tools, like mixed-integer programming and soft constrained MPC, for describing the microgrid components dynamics and the overall system control architecture. Fault tolerant strategies are inserted in order to ensure the proper amount of energy in the storage devices such that (together with the utility grid) the essential consumer demand is always covered.

  abstract = {In this paper, a new approach to worst-case simulation of discrete linear time- invariant interval dynamic systems is proposed. For stable systems, the new approach solves the problem of worst-case simulation by determining the interval hull enclosing the system states region at every iteration through optimisation. The originality of this approach is that it maintains time-invariant parametric uncertainties during the simulation process. Several previous algorithms have considered the case of parametric time-varying uncertainties (El Ghauoi, L., Calafiore, G.: Worst-Case Simulation of Uncertain Systems, in: Garulli, A., Tesi, A., and Vicino, A. (eds), Robustness in Identification and Control, Springer, London, 1999). However, Cuguer' o (Avoiding Possible Instability in Robust Simulation of Stable Parametric Uncertain Time-Invariant Systems, in: Proceedings of 40th Conference on Decision and Control, Florida, 2001) has presented possible instability problems when simulating a time-invariant uncertain system as if it were time-varying, this result being the motivation for the approach proposed in this paper. The optimisation problem associated with the approach proposed must be solved globally in order to guarantee that the minimum volume box enclosing the region of system states has been derived. In this paper, a global optimisation algorithm based on an interval branch and bound strategy is proposed. Finally, two real application examples are used to test the performance of the approach proposed.},

A key feature of the proposed technique is that fault tolerance capability is achieved by a suitable reconfiguration of the system in order to allow the healthy drives to provide additional paths for the currents of the faulty drives. Moreover, a modified control algorithm able to enforce the vector control in damaged drives has been implemented, by cooperatively managing some or all the drives of the system. Therefore, differently from previous techniques, the fault tolerance capability is achieved by exploiting the healthy drives, rather than activating back-up inverter legs. As a result, no additional high-frequency switching power devices and related drives circuitries are needed. In the following, two different scenarios will be analyzed, highlighting pros and cons of the proposed approach through simulations and experimental results.},

The synergy achieved due to this integration will considerably transform how humans' interaction with engineered systems in future smart cities. Such cities will leverage technologies to design, develop, and implement intelligent solutions to provide inclusive development, efficient community infrastructure, and a clean and sustainable environment. One of the domains likely to witness paradigm- shift in future smart cities is transport. The development of urban structures, functionality, and prosperity are intricately connected to how the city designs its mobility infrastructure. Shortly, all vehicles and roadside infrastructures in a city-wide ITS will be enabled with integrated smart sensors, edge computing devices and communication units to provide diversified and inclusive services to its residents. Nonetheless, due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of cross-cutting aspects of CPS, the transportation domain is susceptible to cyber vulnerabilities, threats, illegal access, cyber-attacks, unauthorized information sharing, and so on. This paper attempts to understand smart CPS-enabled transportation systems, it's conceptual framework, the connected and automated vehicles and other associated technologies and communication networks. Finally, we present the expected demands of the transportation domain in a future smart city and the capabilities of CPS in a demand-supply framework. However, the major intellectual challenge lies in effectively designing-developing-deploying models and algorithms to harness the powers of the integrated TCPS system implemented in the intended environment.},

In many of these studies, the vehicles are able to accrue revenue for performing these grid stabilization services, which would offset the increased purchase cost of plug-in hybrid vehicles. To date, all such studies have assumed a vehicle command architecture that allows for a direct and deterministic communication between the grid system operator and the vehicle. This work compares this direct, deterministic vehicle command architecture to an aggregative vehicle command architecture on the bases of the availability, reliability and value of vehicle-provided ancillary services. This research incorporates a new level of detail into the modeling of vehicle-to-grid ancillary services by incorporating probabilistic vehicle travel models, time series ancillary services pricing, and a consideration of ancillary services reliability. Results show that including an aggregating entity in the command and contracting architecture can improve the scale and reliability of vehicle-to-grid ancillary services, thereby making vehicle-to-grid ancillary services more compatible with the current ancillary services market. However, the aggregative architecture has the deleterious effect of reducing the revenue accrued by plug-in vehicle owners relative to the default architectures.},

DC microgrid stability can be an issue under high penetration of tightly regulated power converters used to interface distributed resources and loads. This paper addresses dc microgrid stability under high penetration of tightly regulated power electronic converters; and proposes three simple and computationally efficient active damping solutions that can be implemented to stabilize a controlled voltage-source converter (VSC) interfacing a dc- microgrid to an ac system. The proposed active damping methods depend on reshaping the VSC impedance by injecting internal-model-based active damping signal at the outer, intermediate and inner control loops of the voltage-oriented VSC interface. Small signal analysis is conducted to assess the system stability under different compensation schemes. Moreover, the reshaped source impedance of the VSC interface and the modified voltage-tracking dynamics are derived under different compensation schemes. Sensitivity and robustness analyses are provided to assess the dynamic coupling among active damping and voltage tracking controllers. Evaluation results, based on a detailed model of a dc microgrid with multiple tightly regulated converter-interfaced loads, are provided to validate the developed models and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of proposed techniques.},

Disturbances and both actuator and sensor faults are considered in this paper to design a robust distributed control. The nature of the considered faults is general to deal with any sources, e.g., cyber threats (in the form of data integrity attacks) and sensor issues. In this regard, a mixed \textsubscript{-} formulation is introduced in order to detect and eliminate the undesirable effects of the aforementioned defected components simultaneously, thereby achieving robust performance. Besides, sufficient conditions based on extended linear matrix inequality (also known as LMI) are outlined. Voltage and frequency regulation, active power-sharing, and the state of charge balance of BESSs under faulty conditions are investigated. Different scenarios are tested on a detailed model of a test MG system.

  abstract = {Today's lithium (Li)-ion batteries have been widely adopted as the power of choice for small electronic devices through to large power systems such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs). However, it falls short of meeting the demands of new markets in these areas of EVs or HEVs due to insufficient energy density. Therefore, new battery systems such as Li{\textendash}air batteries with high theoretical specific energy are being intensively investigated, as this technology could potentially make long-range EVs widely affordable. So far, Li{\textendash}air battery technology is still in its infancy and will require significant research efforts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of Li{\textendash}air batteries, with an emphasis on the recent progress of various elements, such as lithium metal anode, cathode, electrolytes, and catalysts. Firstly, it covers the various types of air cathode used, such as the air cathode based on carbon, the carbon nanotube-based cathode, and the graphene-based cathode. Secondly, different types of catalysts such as metal oxide- and composite-based catalysts, carbon- and graphene-based catalysts, and precious metal alloy-based catalysts are elaborated. The challenges and recent developments on electrolytes and lithium metal anode are then summarized. Finally, a summary of future research directions in the field of lithium air batteries is provided.},

The second one, input FTC, is based on three controllers (PI, H{$\infty$} loop shaping and the generalized internal model control), the most appropriate being selected to ensure good behaviour in presence of a multiplicative sensor fault (the fault is modelled as an exponential type emulating a bias). A third architecture, called hybrid FTC, based on the previous output and input fault-tolerant schemes, is built to mitigate simultaneous faults.

  abstract = {The integration of rollover prevention and yaw stability control objectives in electronic stability control (ESC) has traditionally been done based on a priority calculation. The control system nominally focuses on yaw stability control until a danger of rollover is detected. When a danger of rollover is detected, the control system switches from yaw stability control to rollover prevention. This paper focuses on an integrated ESC system wherein the objectives of yaw stability and rollover prevention are addressed simultaneously, rather than one at a time. First, we show that staying on a desired planar trajectory at a specified speed results in an invariant rollover index. This implies that rollover prevention can be achieved whenever there is a danger of rollover only by reducing vehicle speed, since changing the desired vehicle trajectory is not a desirable option. In this regard, it is shown that a vehicle that reduces its speed before entering a sharp curve performs significantly better than a vehicle that uses differential braking during the turn for yaw stability control. Second, this paper explores how the use of steer-by-wire technology can address the tradeoff between yaw stability, speed, and rollover prevention performance. It is shown that the use of traditional steer-by-wire simply as an additional actuator cannot by itself ameliorate the tradeoff. However, this tradeoff can be eliminated if steer-by-wire is used to invert the direction of the roll angle of the vehicle. A new steer-by-wire algorithm that uses transient countersteering is shown to change the location of the rollover dynamics from the neighborhood of an unstable to a stable equilibrium. In this case, a desired trajectory can indeed be achieved by the vehicle at the same speed with a much smaller danger of rollover. This is a novel and viable approach to integrating the yaw stability and rollover prevention functions and eliminating the inherent tradeoffs in the performance of both.},

  abstract = {How to achieve a high transmission rate at a low cost of energy consumption in a wide range of channel variations is a critical challenge in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this article, a rateless 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (R-16QAM) scheme for IoT uplink communications is proposed to deal with this problem. The R-16QAM transmitter consists of an encoder, a random bit selector, and a tailored modulation mapper. Different from the sequential bits selection and Gary mapping in conventional 16QAM modulation, bits are randomly selected and mapped into a 16QAM symbol by a weighted summation of selected bits in R-16QAM. The random bits selection introduces correlation among modulated symbols, enabling the transmitter to work in a rateless manner, i.e., the transmitter keeps generating and sending R-16QAM symbols until a feedback of successful decoding is received from the receiver. It means that the number of symbols transmitted varies with channel variations. In this way, the proposed R-16QAM can automatically adjust to channel conditions and work well in a wide range of channel conditions. The weighted-summation mapping can be illustrated by a ``Tanner graph,'' based on which we develop a low complexity iterative demodulation algorithm to improve receiver performance. The simulations show that compared with narrow band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) standard and Turbo coded light-weight rate compatible modulation (TLRCM) for IoT uplink communications, the proposed R-16QAM scheme can consistently achieve a lower energy consumption in a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) range of -10{\textendash}15 dB. Moreover, it can achieve a maximum transmission throughput of 3.96 bits/s/Hz at SNR=15 dB while only 0.66 and 1.7 bits/s/Hz are achieved in NB-IoT and TLRCM, respectively. These advantages enable the proposed R-16QAM scheme to be particularly suitable to IoT application scenarios where nodes work with limit energy resources under a large range of channel variations.},

This paper evaluates three candidate alternating-current machines and investigates the suitability of different control techniques for the drive systems of battery-powered electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and integrated starter alternators. Accurate flux and torque estimation is the core of any opted control technique for all types of AEV drive systems. Therefore, an accurate closed-loop voltage model flux and torque estimator that is insensitive to stator resistance variation has been designed. This paper also analyzes loss model control and search control (SC) techniques for the drive system's efficiency optimization and proposes an offline SC efficiency optimization technique. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed flux and torque estimator and efficiency optimizer.},

The proper control of motor drives can give a good system response and also increase the efficacy of the drive. Recently the direct torque control (DTC) strategy has drawn great attention for motor drives due to its simplicity, insensitivity to the motor parameters, high reliability and improved dynamic response. Many control strategies have been developed for the improvement of conventional DTC drives focusing specifically on torque and flux. A number of techniques have been formulated and successfully implemented for induction motor (IM) control. This paper aims to provide a substantial updated review, albeit by no means complete, for those who are interested in keeping track of the present state-of-the-art in this field and working further. The review focuses on different control algorithms of DTC IM drives and their applications to minimize the energy losses and improve the system efficacy.},

The main reason is to provide a seamless charging infrastructure in urban and rural areas where the electrical grid is unreliable or unavailable so that EV adoption can be increased worldwide. In this regard, this article reviews the state-of-the-art architectures of the off-grid and hybrid charging systems and investigates their various subsystems, such as single or multiple energy sources, power electronics converters, energy storage systems, and energy management strategies. These subsystems should be optimally integrated and operated to achieve low-cost and efficient EV charging. Moreover, each subsystem is explored in detail to find the current status and technology trends. Furthermore, EV charging connectors, their power level, and standards for all kinds of EVs (ranging from one-wheeler to four-wheelers) are reviewed, and suggestions are discussed related to the non-standardization of charging plugs. Finally, conclusions show the continuous efforts of the researchers in improving the systems in various aspects, such as cost reduction, performance improvement, longevity, negative environmental effect, system size minimization, and efficient operation, and highlight challenges for both charging systems.},

Then, an optimal rotor flux modulus is calculated such that the power loss due to stator, rotor, and core resistances is minimized, and as a consequence, the motor efficiency is raised; therefore, this flux modulus is forced to be tracked by the induction motor along with a desired rotor velocity by means of a high-order sliding-mode controller, the supertwisting algorithm. Using a novel Lyapunov function, the closed-loop stability of the system is demonstrated. Moreover, a classical sliding-mode observer is designed for the estimation of unmeasurable variables like rotor fluxes and magnetization currents. For the load torque, a Luenberger observer is designed. The performance of the proposed controller is finally studied by simulation and experimental tests. It was observed that the steady-state optimal flux signal corresponds to the load torque profile. This fact suggests that the flux demand is the necessary one to produce the electric torque that can cancel out the load torque.},

The proposed strategy includes two parts : one part for fault detection and isolation (FDI) against the line current sensor failures and the other for the FTC reconfiguration. A model based FDI method is developed consisting on a combination of the Robust Integral Sign of the Error (RISE) observer with the algebraic approach to estimate the current residuals dynamics in the stationary reference frame. After detecting the fault occurrence, a decision-making logic unit is then performed to identify the faulty sensors and simultaneously calculates the appropriate current signal that will be used by a Field-Oriented Control (FOC) based speed control scheme. The proposed sensor FTC strategy can be universally applied with any speed control schemes involving IM drives. Besides, the developed fault estimator is simple with a 1-D model, depending only on the input-output measurements and their derivatives and do not require a bank of observers. The robustness of the generated residuals to load torque disturbances and the ability of diagnosing the recovery of a sensor from a fault are also demonstrated. Simulation are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed FTC architecture.},

  abstract = {This paper is dedicated to the synthesis of an active fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for an induction motor (IM) drives in automotive applications in the presence of three current sensors predisposed to arbitrary faults. A differential algebraic approach is applied to perform the fault detection and isolation (FDI) task and to estimate the current residuals dynamics in the stationary reference frame. The resulting residuals are sent next to a decision making unit which detects the fault occurrence and identifies the faulty sensor based on a threshold based scheme. An online reconfiguration is then performed by calculating the appropriate current signal that will be used by a RISE-Backstepping controller to make the drive fault tolerant and to keep system performances unchanged even under faulty current sensor. It is shown that the proposed sensor FTC architecture allows detecting different kind of current sensor faults depending only on the input-output measurements and their derivatives with just a simple 1- D fault estimator model. Besides, it is valid and applicable for any IM drive control schemes and is able to reestablish from sensor fault condition. Furthermore, the used residual threshold is well defined and is suitable for the whole operating range. The robustness of the generated residuals to load torque disturbances is also demonstrated. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme.},

  abstract = {The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to distribute power between the battery and supercapacitor in an electric vehicle so that the fast dynamic power demand is met by the supercapacitor and the slow dynamic is met by the battery. This results in a decline in battery ageing as the supercapacitor absorbs the high charge and discharge stress that would otherwise be imposed on the battery. However, implementing DWT introduces a time delay that increases as the level of decomposition increases. This time delay makes real time implementation difficult. This paper proposes the use of Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Networks with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to predict the power demand from raw data and compensate for the time delay so that DWT based energy management strategy can be implemented in real time. To compensate for the delay introduced by a second level DWT, the LSTM obtained a prediction root mean squared error of 3.69KW for the federal test procedure 72 (FTP72) driving cycle. Simulation results are presented to validate the design.},

To avoid measuring the flux, it is possible to estimate it with the help of models using variables that are easier to acquire. This chapter first suggests an overview of the principle of the two traditional rotor flux observers: a reduced order observer and a full order observer. The major problem linked to the development of a flux observer is the choice of observer gains that adjust the poles and thus the observer dynamics, and also greatly influences observer sensitivity to parametric uncertainties. The chapter then details a theoretical sensitivity study to determine observer gains constituting a good compromise between dynamics, sensitivity and simplicity. The theoretical study is applied to reduced and full order rotor flux observers. Controlled Vocabulary Terms flux flow},

First- and second-order sensitivities of the system variables to changes in system parameters, i.e. non-zero elements of the matrix A, are derived. Two kinds of parameter perturbation are discussed: single parameter perturbation and perturbations of all the system parameters. A structural approach is applied, consisting in partitioning of the system into a number of irreducible, acyclically interconnected subsystems. This approach reduces the computational effort and yields a qualitative sensitivity assessment; i.e. it is possible to exclude the influence of certain parameters on some variables.}

The proposed strategy combines three current sensors and associated observers that estimate the rotor flux. The estimates provided by the observers are compared at each sampling time by a switching mechanism which selects the sensors-observer pair with the smallest error between the estimated flux magnitude and a desired flux reference. The estimates provided by the selected pair are used to implement a vector control law. The authors consider both field-oriented control and direct torque and flux control schemes. Pre-checkable conditions are derived that guarantee fault tolerance under an abrupt fault of a current sensor. These conditions are such that the observers that use measurements from the faulty sensor are automatically avoided by the switching mechanism, thus maintaining good performance levels even in the presence of a faulty sensor. Simulation results under realistic conditions illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme.},

The concept of control strategies for inverter systems to ensure proper microgrid integration has sparked a lot of research towards innovation. This review provides a comprehensive overview and analysis of microgrid integrated control methods and energy management systems for both grid-connected and island-based systems. The Scopus database is used to compile a list of the most cited published papers in the field of microgrid control methods and energy management systems, based on predetermined criteria. In the second week of January 2021, the study was performed using the Scopus database. The papers with the most citations were published in 33 different journals from 30 different countries. An 85\% of the published articles are based on the control system development and experimental setup whereas 15\% are review-based articles. Thus, it can be deduced that this research topic has always been under constant investigation and development in order to enhance the sustainability of microgrid systems in the electric power sector. The paper aims to identify and analyze the highly cited published articles on the respective field to provide future research direction on the microgrid integrated control method and energy management system. The review also underlines numerous factors, issues, challenges, and difficulties that next-generation microgrids must compete with in regards to grid sustainability. Thus, this review will strengthen the scopes and provide context for the development of microgrid integrated control methods and energy management systems in order to achieve an efficient, reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable power supply.},

The main idea of this FTC method, initially developed for LTI systems, is to reconfigure the control loop such that the nominal controller could still be used without need of retuning it. The plant with the faulty actuator/sensor is modified adding the virtual actuator/sensor block that masks the actuator/sensor fault. The suggested technique is an active FTC strategy that reconfigures the virtual actuator/sensor on-line taking into account faults and operating point changes. The stability of the reconfigured control loop is guaranteed if the faulty plant is stabilizable/detectable. The LPV virtual actuator/sensor is designed using polytopic LPV techniques and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A two-tank system simulator is used to assess the performance of the proposed method. In particular, it is shown that the application of the proposed technique results in an improvement, in terms of performance, with respect to the LTI counterpart.},

In contrast to condition numbers, a componentwise sensitivity analysis of the solution vector is performed. Second, to estimate the true solution set for problems whose input data are subject to tolerances. The methods presented are very effective and have the additional property that, owing to an automatic error control mechanism, every computed result is guaranteed to be correct. Examples are given for linear systems, demonstrating that the computed bounds are in general very sharp. Interesting comparisons to traditional condition numbers are given.},

With the help of a recently built multipath fade simulator, we measured rms phase jitter for various combinations of fade notch frequency and fade depth. This paper reports on the experiment and the associated analysis. The times-four method has the virtues that it does not depend upon accurate data decisions, and it does not interact with the receiver's adaptive equalizer. Our results show that the rms phase jitter using this method, for all but the most severe and improbable fades, could be held to a few degrees. Although the measurements were done only for 16 QAM, the analysis predicts only modest increases for higher numbers of levels. The analysis also predicts, and the measurements verify, that the recovered carrier amplitude shrinks to zero for four distinct combinations of fade notch frequency and fade depth. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported in the literature heretofore. We show that, from a statistical viewpoint, the damage associated with it (measured in terms of outage time) should be quite small.},

  abstract = {Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) strategies for Three-Phase Induction Motors (TPIMs) against an open-phase fault have attracted considerable interest in safety-critical applications. In the available literature, open-phase FTC methods for TPIMs are typically implemented using suitable Current Transformation (CT) and Voltage Transformation (VT) matrices. However, the controller design becomes complicated due to different transformations. In addition, the model based on CT and VT suffers from slow dynamics due to several Proportional{\textendash}Integral (PI) controllers. This paper proposes an open-phase FTC technique for TPIM drives with proof of its asymptotic stability. It is designed based on a new CT for stator current components. Using this CT, the traditional vector control method can be used for Open-Phase TPIMs (OPTPIMs). Furthermore, considering that parameters of the PI controller have an important effect on the OPTPIM drive performance, a design technique is presented to achieve the best values of PI controller parameters. Additionally, an open-phase fault detection technique is presented based on the third-difference operator. The proposed FTC has a simple structure and fast dynamic responses. Matlab simulation and experimental results using DSP/TMS320F28335 approve the ability and good performance of the introduced FTC technique for TPIM drive systems under different conditions.},

Erroneous measurements due to malfunctioning of aforementioned sensors can cause significant disruptions in the operation of a PV system, as the impact of erroneous measurements propagate through the controllers in a PV system. In this paper, malfunctioning of PV system sensors are regarded as sensor faults. This paper presents an approach for diagnosis and mitigation of sensor faults in a PV system. The fault diagnosis approach is based on the sliding mode observer (SMO)-based fault detection and identification theory, which is capable of accurately estimating faults in sensor measurements. Estimated faults are used by the fault mitigation technique in the proposed approach to rectify the sensor measurements. The rectified sensor measurements are used by the controllers in PV system, instead of possibly erroneous sensor measurements, which ensure fault resilient operation of the PV system. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been validated through rigorous simulation and experimental studies.},

The fault is detected using a comparison algorithm between the measured and delayed rotor speed signals. The proposed scheme is more practical for diagnosing faults over a wide speed range since it does not use estimated speed value. In addition, to ensure continuous vehicle propulsion and to retain effective field-oriented control of the EV-PMSM in the event of a fault, a reconfiguration mechanism with back-EMF based position observer is employed. Rapid detection of position sensor failure is necessary for a seamless transition from sensored to sensorless control. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between sliding mode observer and flux observer for motor speed control is also presented in the context of EVs. The effectiveness of the position sensors for FDI and FTC is validated in the presence of typical vehicular disturbances, such as uneven road conditions and wind disturbance force. Finally, to validate the proposed approach experimentally in a real-world EV environment, this paper utilizes a scaled-down testbed with a TMS320F28379D DSP for the motor control of the EV.},

  abstract = {The necessity of transport electrification is already undeniable due to, among other facts, global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and fossil-fuel dependency. In this context, electric vehicles (EVs) play a fundamental role. Such vehicles are usually seen by the network as simple loads whose needs have to be supplied. However, they can contribute to the correct operation of the network or a microgrid and the provision of ancillary services and delay the need to reinforce the power lines. These concepts are referred to as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Building (V2B) and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H). In paper, a deep classification and analysis of published charging strategies is provided. In addition, optimal charging strategies must minimise the degradation of the batteries to increase their lifetime, since it is considered that the life of a battery ends when its capacity is reduced by 20\% with respect to its nominal capacity. Therefore, an optimal integration of EVs must consider both grid and batteries impact. Finally, some guidelines are proposed for further research considering the current limitations of electric vehicle technology. Thus, these proposed guidelines are focused on V2G optimal management, enabling new business models while keeping economic viability for all parts involved.},

The IM drive can consume more power than it needs to be, especially when it is operating under conditions under full load. The proposed architecture and its control strategies use ANN to control the amplitude starting current and save more power. The performance of these controllers was verified by simulation using the MATLAB/SIMULINK package, and the results showed good and high performance in the time domain response and rapid rejection of the system disturbance compared to the conventional proportional{\textendash}integral derivative (PID) controller.  Thus, the core loss of IM greatly reduces, thus improving the efficiency of the driving system. Finally, the experimental results were validated which were highly consistent with the simulation results using the DSPACE MicroLabBox controller.},

  abstract = {Centralized communication-based control is one of the main methods that can be implemented to achieve autonomous advanced energy management capabilities in dc microgrids. However, its major limitation is the fact that communication bandwidth and computation resources are limited in practical applications. This can be often improved by avoiding redundant communications and complex computations. In this paper, an autonomous communication-based hybrid state/event driven control scheme is proposed. This control scheme is hierarchical and heuristic, such that on the primary control level, it encompasses state-driven local controllers, and on the secondary control level, an event-driven microgrid centralized controller is used. This heuristic hybrid control system aims at reducing the communication load and complexity, processor computations, and consequently system cost while maintaining reliable autonomous operation during all possible scenarios. A mathematical model for the proposed control scheme using finite state machines has been developed and used to cover all the possible modes/sub-modes of operation, and assure seamless transitions among them during various events. Results of some case studies involving severe operational scenarios were presented and discussed. Results verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed communication-based control scheme.},

  abstract = {Community Microgrid offers effective energy harvesting from distributed energy resources and efficient energy consumption by employing an energy management system (EMS). Therefore, the collaborative microgrids are essentially required to apply an EMS, underlying an operative control strategy in order to provide an efficient system. An EMS is apt to optimize the operation of microgrids from several points of view. Optimal production planning, optimal demand-side management, fuel and emission constraints, the revenue of trading spinning and non-spinning reserve capacity can effectively be managed by EMS. Consequently, the importance of optimization is explicit in microgrid applications. In this paper, the most common control strategies in the microgrid community with potential pros and cons are analyzed. Moreover, a comprehensive review of single objective and multi-objective optimization methods is performed by considering the practical and technical constraints, uncertainty, and intermittency of renewable energies sources. The Pareto-optimal solution as the most popular multi-objective optimization approach is investigated for the advanced optimization algorithms. Eventually, feature selection and neural network-based clustering algorithms in order to analyze the Pareto-optimal set are introduced.},

In this study, a model-based open transistor fault diagnsosis method is presented for a voltage-source inverter (VSI) supplying a five-phase permanent magnet motor drive. To realise this goal, a model-based observer is designed to estimate model parameters. After that, the estimated parameters are used to design a sliding mode observer in order to estimate the phase current in an ideal model. Subsequently, the proposed FD technique measures the similarity between the estimated current and real current using cross-correlation factor. This factor is used for the first time in this study to define a FD index in VSI. The presented FD scheme is simple and fast; also, it is able to detect multiple open switch or open phase faults in contrast to conventional methods. On the other side, in order to track reference current of the motor, the estimated parameters are used to design a proportional resonant controller. The FD technique is used to operate a multiphase fault-tolerant brushless direct current (BLDC) motor drive. Experimental results on a five-phase BLDC motor with in-wheel outer rotor applicable in electrical vehicles are conducted to validate the theory.},

These schemes do not use any kind of machine model and motor parameters. This is a prominent feature of the proposed approaches, which only rely on main concepts of field-oriented control (FOC)-based IM drives. Moreover, the proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI) schemes can take partial sensor failures into account. These kinds of faults that might be caused by mechanical or electrical failures, or intentional sensor tampering, are difficult to be dealt with since embedded speed and current control loops react swiftly, and inherently try to camouflage partial sensor failures. CS faults result in imbalance current flow in the motor stator phases, and speed sensor fault repudiates the orthogonally alignment of field and torque current components in field oriented IM drives. These features are cornerstones of introduced FDI methodology. Furthermore, model and parameter free compensators are proposed to recover normal operation of the machine before fault incident. After in-depth analysis, extensive simulation and experimental tests validate the proposed schemes.},

The increase need for more effective power electrical systems control turned the development of smart grids, the main object of study for many researchers. This paper proposes a digital system for condition monitoring, diagnosis and supervisory control applied to smart grids. The system is based on hybrid network architecture (HNA), consisting of a wired infrastructure, a wireless sensor network (WSN), a power line communications (PLC) and a controller area network (CAN). The system is based on three hardware topologies: remote data acquisition units (RDAUs), intelligent sensors modules (ISMs) and a PLC modem. The basic characteristics are: a) easy/low cost implementation, b) easy to set up by user, c) easy implementation of redundant routines (security), d) portability/versatility, and e) open system. To validate the developed system, it was implanted in one underground electric substation power distribution, characterized as an extremely hostile environment for supervisory control applications. In this application, the main challenge is to establish a communication system installed inside the substation with the outside (operations center-OC) considering that there are not commercial solutions appropriate to solve completely this problem.},

  abstract = {Model-based sensor fault detection, isolation and accommodation (SFDIA) is a direction of development in particular with UAVs where sensor redundancy may not be an option due to weight, cost and space implications. SFDIA via neural networks (NNs) have been proposed over the years due to their nonlinear structures and online learning capabilities. The majority of papers tend to consider single sensor faults. While useful, this assumption can limit application to real systems where sensor faults can occur simultaneously or consecutively. In this paper we consider the latter scenario, where it is assumed that a 1 s time gap is present between consecutive faults. Furthermore few applications have considered fixed-wing UAVs where full autonomy is most needed. In this paper an EMRAN RBF NN is chosen for modelling purposes due to its ability to adapt well to nonlinear environments while maintaining high computational speeds. A nonlinear UAV model is used for demonstration, where decoupled longitudinal motion is considered. System and measurement noise is also included in the UAV model as wind gust disturbances on the angle of attack and sensor noise, respectively. The UAV is assumed to operate at an initial trimmed condition of speed, 32 m/s and altitude, 1000 m. After 30 separate SFDIA tests implemented on a 1.6 GHz Pentium processor, the NN-SFDIA scheme detected all but 2 faults and the NN processing time was 97\% lower than the flight data sampling time.},

This paper presents a technical review of each and every sub-system and its feasible control of battery EV (BEV) propulsion units. The study includes the possible combination of electrical machines (EMs), storage system, and power electronic converters and their associated control strategies. The primary unit, i.e., EM, is the heart of the EV, which is used to drive the vehicle at the desired speed as well as to restore the regenerative braking (RB) energy that is generated to enhance the overall system reliability. To electrify the transportation sector, it is necessary to include new options of power electronic converter topologies and their associated control strategies for numerous reasons, which include extracting maximum power from sources in case the EV is powered from renewable energy resources, boosting the energy storage capability for longer electric range, managing power flow from the source to battery or battery to vehicle or vehicle to battery, and regulating the speed of the vehicle and braking control. Based on the survey, the suitable combination of sub-systems and their control for three and four-wheeler EVs are summarized in this paper.},

An innovative method to estimate the three-phase currents from dc-link current is presented. A sinusoidal curve-fitting observer that does not use any of the load parameters is employed. Using the firing signals and the dc-link current for corrective action, the observer generates stable three-phase feedback signals, even during short periods when the phase current information is not present in the dc-link current.},

Significant findings within the local market and across markets belonging to the countries of concern and research recommendations addressing the issues have been discussed as a result of the study conducted with data obtained from the vehicle manufacturer's website, government statistical institutes, and other affiliated survey organizations, as well as technical reports published online. These qualitative and quantitative findings and recommendations will aid in the creation of EV and charging station designs, as well as the formulation of strategies aimed at generating more cost-effective EV designs that take into account local usage patterns, car kinds, and performance. It also assists legislators in their efforts to streamline EV policy. Consideration of these issues aids in the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.},

Simulations which include ideal battery model and ideal DC bus capacitor model do not give realistic results about battery ripple current.

Here, single and multiple Hall-effect sensor faults are analyzed, and a method to detect, identify, and mitigate such faults is investigated. The method is general, and it ensures proper operation of the drive and is not dependent on the particular estimation algorithm that is used; by way of example, here it will be applied to a vector-tracking observer.

  abstract = {With the increasing demand for electric vehicles, the interest in battery systems is growing. In order to enable safe operation of these complex energy storage systems, methods of fault diagnosis are needed. Particularly, reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) with switches are promising on the way to fault tolerance as they allow the system to be reconfigured in the event of a fault. In this article, a model-based fault diagnosis algorithm is developed and validated that uses the switches of an RBS to improve the fault isolability. Since the algorithm changes the structure of the system in order to differentiate between nonisolable faults, it is classified as an active fault diagnosis algorithm. The deviations between sensor measurements and model, called residuals, are stochastically analyzed. For fault isolation, a fuzzy clustering approach is used. A constrained sigma-point Kalman filter minimizes model uncertainties and therefore increases the sensitivity and robustness of the fault diagnosis approach. Furthermore, the filter allows estimating the fault amplitude in case of a fault. Based on active sequential hypothesis testing, a policy to calculate the next switch position is proposed and investigated. It is shown simulatively and experimentally that additional faults are isolated by the presented active approach.},

Radiality and capacity constraints are taken into account. This optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, in which the integer variables represent the state of the switches, and the continuous variables represent the current flowing through the branches. The standard Newton method (with second derivatives) is used to compute branch currents at each stage within the integer search, which, in turn, is implemented as a simple best-first search. Although a best-first search cannot normally guarantee the optimality of the solution, the high quality of the suboptimal solutions found, together with the high processing speed, make this approach very attractive for real-size distribution systems. Results from the application of the proposed methodology to a 1128-branch, 129-switch, real-world distribution system are presented and discussed.},

Particularly when used for the daily commute, most EV drivers will rely on a nightly charge in their garage, for instance. In typical European urban residential areas, however, private parking and charging resources are severely limited. Therefore, public on-street charging often is the only option. However, it faces several limitations that lead to an inefficient and unfair utilization of charging stations, or EV supply equipment (EVSE). For instance, EVSEs are often blocked by fully charged vehicles. We thus propose and evaluate a cooperative protocol for EVs that facilitates coordinated handovers of EVSEs. We integrate this protocol with the ISO 15118 standard and provide a detailed security analysis. In the evaluation, we show that coordinated handovers significantly improve both EVSE utilization (helping to amortize the expensive operating costs) and provide benefits for EV owners by providing sufficient charging resources. This reduces range anxiety and saves them from cruising for charging.},

Microgrids contain distributed power generation units, energy storage devices, and controllable loads with the capability to operate in both grid-connected and island modes. The economic operation of a microgrid is achieved through an energy management system that optimally schedules DGs and storage devices and continuously balances supply and demand. In this study, a formulation of optimal unit commitment (UC) and dispatch scheduling of DGs in a grid-connected microgrid system is presented. Mixed-integer linear programming is used to implement the optimal UC and dispatch scheduling model. The objective is to minimise the overall operating cost of the system by optimally utilising an energy storage device and a combined heat and power (CHP) generation unit using load and renewable energy generation prediction. Operational constraints such as generation limits of DGs, battery charging/discharging limits and state-of-charge limits are to be satisfied during all intervals of operation. Simulation results indicate that the operational cost of the system is significantly reduced through optimal scheduling of an energy storage system and a CHP unit using the proposed strategy.},

  abstract = {Progress in Microgrid (MG) research has evolved the MG concept from classical, purely MG power networks to more advanced power and communications networks. The communications infrastructure helps control and manage the unreliable power outputs that most standard power generation elements of the MG (e.g., wind turbines and photo-voltaic panels) deliver. Although communication technologies do offer certain advantages for sensing and control, they generate other complications due to packet loss and packet latency, among other transmission impairments. In this work, we discuss the impact of communications on MG performance, establishing the requirements of data exchanges and system response in the three levels of a hierarchical control approach: primary, secondary, and tertiary. With a focus on the secondary level - responsible for ensuring the restoration of electrical parameters - we identify standards, networking protocols, and communication technologies relevant for the interoperability of MGs and clusters of MGs, including both modes of operation: isolated and grid-connected. We review theoretical approaches and practical implementations that consider the effects of the communications network on the general performance of the MG. Moreover, we undertake an experimental analysis of the influence of wired and wireless communication networks on MG performance, revealing the importance of designing future smart control solutions more robust to communication degradation, especially if wireless technologies are integrated to provide scalable deployments. Aspects such as resilience, security, and interoperability are also shown to require continuing efforts in research and practical applications.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel fault tolerant consensus-based secondary voltage and frequency restoration method considering disturbances and actuator faults by using the sliding mode control for islanded microgrids (MGs). Existing distributed methods commonly design restoration layer based on the ideal condition that the actuators of distributed generations (DGs) function healthily and there are no faults and disturbances, whereas MGs are exposed to actuator faults of biased fault and partial loss of effectiveness fault. Faults and disturbances have a great impact on control of MG, which terribly reduce the stability and quality of it. To eliminate the adverse effects of them, this paper explicitly addresses the consensus problem for frequency and voltage restoration of MGs, whereas providing stringent real power sharing, in the presence of actuation/propulsion faults and disturbances. To this end, we derive the consensus restoration proof using rigorous Lyapunov analysis. As a result, the suggested method decreases the sensitivity of the system to failures and increases its reliability. Unlike conventional distributed controllers, the proposed approach quickly reaches consensus and exhibits a more accurate robust performance. Finally, we have performed several simulation scenarios in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems Toolbox to illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.},

We first derive the available range of the CNPC links between UAVs and a ground control station. The available range is defined as the maximal horizontal communication distance within which the round-trip delay and the overall packet loss probability can be ensured with a required probability. To exploit the macro-diversity gain of the distributed multi-antenna systems (DAS) and the array gain of the centralized multi-antenna systems (CAS), we consider a modified DAS (M-DAS), where the ground control station is equipped with the distributed access points (APs), and each AP can have multiple antennas. We then show that the available range can be maximized by judiciously optimizing the altitude of UAVs, the duration of the uplink and downlink phases, and the antenna configuration. To solve the non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm that can converge to the optimal solution in DAS and CAS, and then extend it into more general M-DAS. The simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show that the available range of M-DAS can be significantly larger than those of the DAS and CAS.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of adaptive active fault-tolerant control for a class of nonlinear systems with unknown actuator fault is investigated. The actuator fault is assumed to have no traditional affine appearance of the system state variables and control input. The useful property of the basis function of the radial basis function neural network (NN), which will be used in the design of the fault tolerant controller, is explored. Based on the analysis of the design of normal and passive fault tolerant controllers, by using the implicit function theorem, a novel NN-based active fault-tolerant control scheme with fault alarm is proposed. Comparing with results in the literature, the fault-tolerant control scheme can minimize the time delay between fault occurrence and accommodation that is called the time delay due to fault diagnosis, and reduce the adverse effect on system performance. In addition, the FTC scheme has the advantages of a passive fault-tolerant control scheme as well as the traditional active fault-tolerant control scheme's properties. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant control scheme requires no additional fault detection and isolation model which is necessary in the traditional active fault-tolerant control scheme. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed techniques.},

This digital control method can control three-phase squirrel cage IM system and enables motoring and generating operation. This method is extremely simple in design and implementation.

However, emergency stop is not necessarily the best way to react if current sensor fails. This paper proposes a survivable operation technique for three-phase IM drives in the event of current sensor failure. The basic objective of survivable operation for IM is to seamlessly switch the control method from vector control to a simplified digital control with smooth transition strategy in the event of current sensor failure. Using this technique, the IM system can be kept running even when there are current sensor faults. It can therefore add one extra redundancy in EVs and make them safer and more reliable. Simulation and experimental results, including current sensor failure detection, speed and torque response, voltage vector, and phase-current waveforms, are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

The equations of such systems are not ordinary differential equations, but descriptor equations, i.e., differential equations where the coefficient of the highest order derivative is singular. An asymptotic observer in descriptor form based on pole assignment techniques is used in the time-invariant case to reconstruct the positions, velocities, and contact forces. For time invariant constrained dynamical systems subject to random disturbances, an optimal estimator in descriptor form is designed based on Wiener-Hopf theory. Constrained dynamical systems yield descriptor systems that are uncontrollable and unobservable at infinity. As a consequence, the observer and estimator may not change the infinite eigenstructure of the system. Examples are given to illustrate the use of our method.},

The optimal cooperative control law is designed from a modified linear quadratic regulator method and an inverse optimal control formulation. Three cost function terms are constructed to address the consensus, control effort, and cooperative tracking, respectively. Three distinct features of this approach can be achieved. First, the optimal feedback control law is derived analytically without involving any numerical solution. Second, this formulation guarantees both asymptotic stability and optimality. Third, the cooperative control law is distributed and only requires local information based on the communication topology to enable the agents to achieve consensus and track a desired trajectory. The performance of this optimal cooperative control method is demonstrated through an example of attitude synchronization of multiple satellites.},

The dynamic and synchronization properties of the MDS are affected by both the mechanical and electric subsystems. Generally, the load and speed of the MDS is time-varying. Therefore, this paper presents an electromechanical coupling dynamic model of MDS that can reflect the characteristics of MDS under time-varying load and speed conditions. Based on the developed model, the dynamic and synchronization properties of MDS are investigated under three typical conditions. Meanwhile, a series of experiments are conducted for comparison with the theoretical analysis. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the current can be used to monitor the torque and its synchronization, and reflect the vibration characteristics of the MDS. The components of response frequency of the current signal do not change with the speed of MDS, but the amplitudes of the response frequency change with the system speed. Similarly, this phenomenon can also be observed in the spectra of the torque, speed, and vibration acceleration signal.},

Up to now, the calculation models of the efficiency of the induction motor for electric vehicles are less accurate over some operating regions, such as owing to omitting the variations of the motor parameters with frequency. The paper puts forward a calculation model of the induction motor efficiency in the entire region of operation, including the constant-power region and the constant-torque region. And in this paper, the new methods of the iron loss calculating and stray loss calculating are deduced. With the model, the efficiency influenced by motor parameters can be considered at the stage of the motor design. So the optimal design could be done for the high efficiency of motors. The validity of the model has been verified by the experiment results of the 30 kW induction motor.},

Tesla's induction motor is very enigmatic so the paper tries to introduce a basic model. This secrecy could be interesting for the engineering and physics students. Multidisciplinary problem is considered: kinematics, mechanics, electric motors, numerical methods, control of electric drives. Identification based on three points in the steady-state torque-speed curve of the induction motor is presented. The field weakening mode of operation of the motor is analyzed. The Kloss' formula is obtained. The main aim of the article is determination of a mathematical description of the torque vs. speed curve of induction motor and its application for vehicle motion modeling. Additionally, the moment of inertia of the motor rotor and the electric vehicle mass are considered in one equation as electromechanical system. Presented approach may seem like speculation, but it allows to understand the problem of a vehicle motion. The article composition is different from classical approach - studying should be intriguing.},

The sensitivity of the EKF to round-off errors is well known, and numerically advantageous implementations based on the square-root decomposition of covariance matrices have been developed to address this issue. However, these techniques have not been applied in the EKF-based sensorless control of ac drives yet. Specific properties of the fixed-point implementation of the EKF for a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive are presented in this paper, and suitability of various square-root algorithms for this case is discussed. Three square-root algorithms-Bierman-Thorton, Carlson-Schmidt-Givens, and Carlson-Schmidt-Householder-were implemented, and their performances are compared to that of the standard implementation based on full covariance matrices. Results of both simulation studies and experimental tests performed on a developed sensorless PMSM drive prototype of rated power of 10.7 kW are presented. It was confirmed that the square-root algorithms improve the behavior of the sensorless control in critical operating conditions such as low speeds and speed reversal. In particular, the Carlson-Schmidt-Givens algorithm was found to be well suited for the considered drive.},

One of the most accurate control schemes is encodered rotor flux orientated vector control. The advantages and disadvantages of this control are well known and several variations, or reduced vector schemes, have been proposed. This study introduces an improved encoderless scalar, or approximated vector, control method for induction machines which can be applied to general purpose applications that do not require the most precise control. The proposed method overcomes practical difficulties and is suitable for industrial applications. The slip compensated stator flux linkage oriented scheme proposed in this study does not require flux estimation or a speed sensor, only requiring nameplate data, stator current and stator resistance measurement, which can easily be determined at start-up. Simulation and experimental investigations including field weakening operation and the effect of stator resistance variation demonstrate the improved performance of the new scheme compared to previous open loop V/Hz and stator resistive compensated schemes especially at low rotor speeds.},

In order to maintain an uninterrupted motor drive operation even under its faulty condition, two diagnostic algorithms as well as post-fault control techniques are developed. According to the first diagnostic system, that is related to single open-circuit faults in two-level voltage inverter, a failure diagnosis is performed by monitoring a time presence of a reference inverter voltage vector in particular sectors of the {$\alpha$}{\textendash}{$\beta$} coordinate system. After the fault detection, to maintain a high-quality drive performance, a switch-redundant inverter scheme is utilized. In case of the second diagnostic system, for the speed sensor failure detection, a motor speed estimator, that is based on a model reference adaptive system, is utilized. This algorithm is used for the post-fault motor drive operation as well. Both fault monitoring methods are based on a software solution, therefore they do not generate additional implementation costs. To validate the described fault-tolerant control scheme, chosen simulation tests, which were carried out in MATLAB/Simulink, are presented. Additionally, in case of the transistor failure diagnosis, experimental tests were carried out.},

The PI observer has two feedback loops, a proportional loop and an integral loop of the estimation error. In this way the PI observer combines the structures of the practical orientated nonlinearity observer developed by the third author and the classical Luenberger observer. The structure and the estimation performance of the PI observer are discussed and analysed. The results show that the PI observer can estimate the states not only of linear systems, but also, more significantly, of systems with any arbitrary external input which appear as unknown input, nonlinearity or unmodelled dynamics. It is shown that the PI observer works with weak assumptions, which can be fulfilled by many classes of systems to be observed. Owing to the weak assumptions it can improve many observer-based technical solutions as diagnosis or control based on observers. In the paper the conditions are given and proved. The design method is declared and carried out with illustrative examples of a linear system and of a nonlinear system of a link manipulator with flexible joints. The results are good and they show the efficiency of the PI observer. In the case of nonlinear systems the advantages of `robustness' and the model independency of the proposed observer scheme can be shown clearly.},

Accordingly, these cases are considered as disturbances for unknown input observer and their effects on the residual signal are eliminated.

  abstract = {This paper presents three phase current reconstruction methods for a three-level neutral point clamped inverter (NPCI) by measuring the voltage of a shunt resistor placed in the neutral point of the inverter. In order to accurately acquire the phase currents from the shunt resister, the dwell time of the active voltage vectors need to exceed the minimum time. On the other hand, if the time of active voltage is shorter than the minimum time, the current measurement becomes impossible. In this paper, unmeasurable regions for current are classified into three areas. Area 1 is a region in which both phase currents can be measure. Therefore, it is not necessary to restore the current. In Area 2, only one phase current can be measured. Thus, an estimation or restoration method is needed to measure another phase current. In this paper, the current estimation method using an electrical model of the motor is proposed. Area 3 is the region in which both phase currents can not be measured. In this case, it is necessary to move the voltage vector to the current measurable area by injecting the voltage. In this paper, Area 3 is divided into 36 sectors to inject optimal voltage. The proposed methods have the advantages of high current measurement accuracy and low THD (total harmonic distortion). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified through experimental results.},

The introduction of a redundant phase-leg that is shared by three converters in a standard SHEV powertrain allows us to maximize the reliability improvement with minimal part-count increase. Therefore, the cost increase is kept to minimum as well. The new topology features fast response in fault detection and isolation, and postfault operation at rated power throughput. Two implementations of the fault-tolerant design are presented in conjunction with elaborated discussion of the operating principles, control schemes, and fault diagnostic methods. The substantially improved reliability over standard SHEV powertrains is demonstrated by analysis of the Markov reliability model. Time-domain simulation based on a Saber model has been conducted and the results have verified the feasibility and performance of the proposed SHEV drive system. A scaled-down laboratory prototype has been built and the experimental results further validate the robust fault detection/isolation scheme and uncompromised postfault performance.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a general torque distribution strategy is proposed to improve the drivetrain efficiency of four-wheel-drive electric vehicles (EVs). The strategy allows the same or different motors to be equipped in the front and rear wheels. The model of the drivetrain considers the loss properties of four permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) and four inverters over a wide range of torque and speed. The relationship between the drivetrain efficiency and the torque split ratio at any given speed is proven to be convex under both traction and regenerative braking conditions. It is shown that, when all four motors are identical, the maximum efficiency can be achieved if the total torque is equally shared. An equivalent loss strategy, which is a general method and can solve many optimization problems of multi-PMSM applications, is proposed to maximize the drivetrain efficiency when different PMSMs are used in the front and rear wheels. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using an urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS). In addition, the acceleration process of EVs is optimized using a dynamic programming approach to minimize acceleration duration and energy consumption. Simulation results show that, with the proposed strategy, the energy loss during the acceleration can be reduced by up to 15\%.},

The failure if not detected at its early stages, can result in a total loss of the machine itself, in addition to a likely costly downtime of the whole plant sometimes may even result in the loss of lives. In this paper, a method based on PVA for detection of induction motor faults is presented. Using suggested method it is also possible to discriminate the type of fault by pattern recognition. This paper also focuses on the detection of the mixed faults in squirrel induction motors. In order to evaluate the ability of the method several simulation results are performed. The simulated results suggest that this method is effective and accurate and can be widely used in the induction motor fault diagnosis.},

For this reason, many fault-tolerant topologies and strategies have been deeply studied, mainly focusing on improving the electromechanical behavior of the reconfigured drive after the fault. However, it is also very important to evaluate the possible increase of power losses. In this paper, a power loss analysis is performed on a current-controlled three-phase inverter supplying a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (just chosen as an example), for all the operating modes, starting from the fault occurrence until the faulty operation mode is established. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a fault-tolerant control strategy depends on the possibility to maintain a continuous operation. The latter is ensured only if there is no such increment of the losses that the survival of the component is at risk. The simulations are validated by means of experimental tests, and the results are discussed. The method can be easily applied to other topologies and reconfiguration strategies.},

There are both long-term and short-term measures that system operators can employ for resilience reinforcement. Longer-term measures include infrastructure hardening and resilient planning, while short-term operational measures are applied in the pre-event, during-event and post-event phases. Microgrids (MGs) can effectively enhance resilience for both transmission and distribution systems, due to their ability to operate in a controlled, coordinated way, when connected to the main power grid and in islanded mode. In this paper, MG-based strategies for resilience enhancement are presented, including MG-based resilient planning and MG-based operational measures, consisting of preventive MG scheduling and emergency measures and MG-based system restoration. Classification of literature is made by considering whether the transmission system, distribution system or individual MG resilience is targeted. The way uncertainties are handled by various methods is also outlined. Finally, challenges and future research requirements for improving MG-based power system resilience are highlighted.},

Through conversion of commands into non-periodic voltage values in the synchronous qd0 reference frame, hand-off transient reduction is achieved by controlling the rate of change of stator voltage commands during changeover. Through this method, smooth switched supervisory control can be achieved without synchronization or phase coordination between different commands from different controllers. Controllers are selected based on available sensor feedback. A system containing three controllers is simulated and tested with simulated sensor loss. Results of the proposed smooth switching controller compared to abrupt switching between control commands are compared. The proposed scheme is shown to reduce current and torque transients and maintain smooth operation of the drive. Given that multiple controllers and the switching logic are computationally intensive from an embedded system perspective, the proposed method is verified to operate in a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) environment on a Texas Instruments C2000 microcontroller.},

Their intermittent behavior and limited storage capabilities present a new challenge to power system operators to maintain power quality and reliability. Additional technical complexity arises from the large number of small distributed generation units and their allocation within the power system. Market liberalization and changing regulatory framework lead to additional organizational complexity. As a result, the design and operation of the future electric energy system have to be redefined. Sophisticated information and communication architectures, automation concepts, and control approaches are necessary in order to manage the higher complexity of so-called smart grids. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art and recent developments enabling higher intelligence in future smart grids.

In this study, an augmented observer is designed to simultaneously estimate system states, and current sensor faults. In order to attenuate the effects from the modelling error and environment disturbances/noises, a genetic algorithm is employed to design observer gain by minimizing the estimation error against modelling errors and environmental disturbances/noises.

In this paper, novel design of feedback gains of the observer is proposed to achieve the stability over the whole operation especially in the low-speed region, including the regenerating mode. Stability improvement using the proposed feedback gains is rigorously proven by the method of Lyapunov. For the adaptation proportional-integral (PI) gains, the ramp response characteristic of the speed estimator is proposed as design guidelines. It is revealed that the integral adaptation gain determines the tracking error of the speed estimator during acceleration/deceleration while the sensitivity to current measurement noises depends on the proportional adaptation gain. It is also pointed out that a suitable corner frequency of the adaptation PI gains is required as a design tradeoff to avoid an oscillation. The validity of all theoretical results is verified by simulation and experiment.},

Growing attention is being paid to the use of six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) and their parallel control by two inverters, because of their reduced size and enhanced safety. This paper proposes a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) control algorithm for a six-phase PMSM. In low-voltage vehicle components such as electric power steering, the current is usually acquired with resistors placed under the low-side switching devices. In the proposed control algorithm, the neutral voltage of the two inverters is shifted to either a lower or higher voltage within a certain range to allow for the signal conditioning time delay after the switching device turns on or off, and the time taken for the phase current to rise or settle. The paper proposes a novel PWM control algorithm that ensures that the on-time of the low-side switching devices satisfies the restriction on current sensing with resistors and reduces the current in the capacitor at the same time. The work contributes to reducing the current in a practical configuration involving low-voltage vehicle components.},

In harsh industrial environments, due to extra electrical, magnetic, and thermal stresses, different faults in TPIMs can happen. One of the challenging subjects for many researchers is the development of control methods for TPIMs during fault conditions. Open-circuit fault in the stator windings of TPIMs is one of the most common types of faults in industrial drive systems. The aim of this research is to present a review on existing control methods for TPIM drives during open-circuit fault. These control methods are classified based on Magneto-Motive Force (MMF), Transformation Matrices (TMs), and harmonic injection. An overall description of each method is discussed and a comprehensive list of references is reported for each method. This review provides some recommendations on different control strategies for the research and development of TPIM drives during open-circuit fault.},

The proposed active FTC system is illustrated using two control techniques: indirect field-oriented control (IFOC) in the case of healthy sensors and speed control with slip regulation (SCSR) in the case of failed current sensors. The main objective behind the reconfiguration strategy is to achieve a short and smooth transition when switching from a controller using a healthy sensor to another sensorless controller in the case of a sensor failure. The proposed FTC approach performances are experimentally evaluated on a 7.5-kW induction motor drive.},

Software redundancy has been evaluated in case of speed sensor failure. Hardware redundancy has been used in the case of power inverter failures with a fault-tolerant 4-leg topology.

The proposed scheme is divided into four steps. First of all, an unmatched nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is established based on the 4WDW EV model to estimate the equal disturbance and compensate for the modeling error. Then, a state tracker with estimated unmatched nonlinear disturbance is designed. Followed by the design of a novel adaptive sliding mode fault-tolerant control (ASM-FTC) strategy based on NDOB. Finally, control efforts allocate according to the degree of motor failure. On the one hand, controller parameters are capable of self-adaptively reconfiguring such that a faster convergence can be realized. On the other hand, better tracking performance is guaranteed with the application of estimated disturbance information in the control law. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed method in various driving scenarios.},

  abstract = {In this study, a direct torque control (DTC) strategy based on a novel switching table for induction motor drives fed by the eight-switch three-phase inverter (ESTPI), which is the post-fault reconfigured topology for the three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter with the open-circuit fault occurring in a leg, is proposed to reduce the torque ripple and suppress the dc-link capacitor voltages offset. The influence of each basic voltage vector provided by the ESTPI on the stator flux, the electromagnetic torque and the dc-link capacitor voltages is analysed in detail, and the causes of the torque ripple and the capacitor voltages offset are also revealed. To suppress the dc-link capacitor voltages offset, a hysteresis comparator is added to regulate the dc-link capacitor voltages. Based on that, an optimised switching table to achieve not only torque ripple reduction but also dc-link capacitor voltages offset suppression is proposed. The feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed DTC strategy are verified by simulations and experimental results.},

Moreover, the faults considered in this paper are incipient. First, the DC-link model is established, and the fault is detected by the residual of the DC-link voltage. Next, the differential of DC-link voltage residual is calculated, which is applied to fault location. Then, according to the change of the differential values, different fault types are determined. Finally, the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is built and the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by the HIL tests.},

It does not require space vector modulation, therefore there is no need to make any complex changes after the fault.

However, the application of smart control strategies is still far to become a significant part of the available scientific publications. Within the employed techniques, model predictive control appeared as the most promising method to control thermal energy storage systems. Therefore, in this paper, the application of this control strategy is widely studied. Regarding this analysis, significant literature gaps that have to be studied more in detail are found in the current scientific publications. The main goal of this study is to find out these gaps through a bibliometric approach, identifying the key knowledge areas using both databases Web of Science and Scopus. Results show that the main knowledge gaps in the literature are the ones related with a validation of model predictive control, its implementation in smart grids, an optimized sizing and management of the physical parts of the system, an accurate weather forecasting, and to exploit as much as possible the available renewable energy resources. Moreover, the tendency in publications during the whole period, the main authors, countries, and organisations are analysed.},

  abstract = {In the most common hierarchical control structure for microgrids, the secondary control layer relies on communication technologies for receiving feedback data and sending control commands. The imperfections of communication such as the delays can cause oscillations during the voltage and frequency restoration which degrade the power quality. This work aims at studying this effect in the case of a typical AC microgrid in the islanded mode. For this purpose, stochastic delay models for industrial communication protocols are combined with a simulation model of the microgrid together with its control system up to the secondary level. The results illustrate how the choice of communication technology can affect the transient response. Additionally, compensation of the control performance for the effects of communication is considered. A simple method is used to improve the control performance only by retuning the controller coefficients, without altering the standard control structure. It is shown that appropriate retuning of the secondary controller can prevent from oscillations caused by the delays and improve the power quality to some extent. The presented framework can be used for designing and verifying the combination of communication and control subsystems in microgrids.},

  abstract = {The focus of this paper is an integrated, fault-tolerant vehicle supervisory control algorithm for the overall stability of ground vehicles. Vehicle control systems contain many sensors and actuators that can communicate with each other over communication networks. The proposed supervisory control scheme is composed of a high-level controller that creates a virtual control input vector and a low-level control allocator that distributes the virtual control effort among redundant actuators. Virtual control input incorporates the required traction force, yaw, pitch, and roll moment corrections, and the lateral force correction to ensure stability while following a maneuvering reference initiated by the driver. Based on the virtual control input vector, the allocation module determines front steering angle correction, rear steering angle, traction forces at each tire, and active suspension forces. The proposed control framework distinguishes itself from earlier results in the literature by its ability to adapt to failures and uncertainties by updating its parameters online, without the need for fault identification. The control structure is validated in the simulation environment using a fourteen degree of freedom nonlinear vehicle model. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures that the vehicle follows references created by the driver despite the loss of actuator effectiveness up to 30\% higher longitudinal maneuver velocity and approximately 35\% lower roll and pitch angles during steering with representative driving scenarios.},

  abstract = {Grid interconnected multi-microgrids provides potential benefits to the consumers, where the microgrids (MGs) equipped with distributed generators (DGs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and diesel generators. However, intermittency of DGs, high cost of ESSs, and depleting fossil fuels are the major challenges for the economic operation of interconnected multi-microgrids. One potential way to address these challenges is to develop an energy management strategy (EMS) for the grid interconnected multi-microgrids. This paper proposes an EMS to reduce consumer energy consumption cost (ECC) using fuzzy-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange algorithm with dynamic pricing. In this context, the MGs consumers load power demand (LPD) and DGs output behaviors are modeled using random vector functional link network approach to predict future time slot values. Then, a fuzzy-based P2P energy exchange algorithm is developed to enable the surplus energy transfer to grid and/or MGs with dynamic pricing. Furthermore, an ESS charging/discharging energy control and diesel generator turn on strategies are developed based on the MGs deficit power. Then, the MGs consumer LPD reduction strategy is implemented based on the consumer ECC margin and energy consumption index. Finally, an EMS is proposed that includes on demand-supply strategy and consumer energy consumption cost reduction strategy based on the future time slot values. The novelty of the proposed work lies within the energy management of grid interconnected multi-microgrids and the reduction of consumers ECC through surplus energy transfer to grid and/or MGs using fuzzy-based P2P energy exchange algorithm with dynamic pricing. Historical data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS for grid interconnected multi-microgrids.},

The speed and rotor resistance are estimated simultaneously, which is reported in many papers as impossible. The estimation is achieved using a reduced order Kalman filter to reduce the computational burden. This algorithm uses a reduced order model of the motor. The model takes into account the coupling between the electrical and mechanical modes, which is true for small size machines. The method proposed in this paper is applicable to a large category of induction motor drives with a gradually varying load torque such as viscous friction, fan/blower and centrifugal pump. A fully real-time digital simulation, a new powerful tool for rapid control prototyping, is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that accurate estimation is achieved under both transient and steady state conditions without injecting any external signal. This achievement is, to the best of authors' knowledge, reported for the first time and is believed to be of great importance for induction machine sensorless control.},

A second-order sliding mode observer (SMO) is designed to estimate the grid voltage parameters based on the exosystem model. Moreover, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop SMO is proved. Simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which achieves fast response and accurate estimation},

So far, no systematic approach has been implemented in order to attack this problem. The solution presented consists of two major steps. First the matrix equations and matrix inequalities are reduced to polynomial inequalities. Then Collins' algorithm is applied to settle the solvability of the problem and to compute an observer.

  abstract = {The issues of global warming and depletion of fossil fuels have paved opportunities to electric vehicle (EV). Moreover, the rapid development of power electronics technologies has even realized high energy-efficient vehicles. EV could be the alternative to decrease the global green house gases emission as the energy consumption in the world transportation is high. However, EV faces huge challenges in battery cost since one-third of the EV cost lies on battery. This paper reviews state-of-the-art of the energy sources, storage devices, power converters, low-level control energy management strategies and high supervisor control algorithms used in EV. The comparison on advantages and disadvantages of vehicle technology is highlighted. In addition, the standards and patterns of drive cycles for EV are also outlined. The advancement of power electronics and power processors has enabled sophisticated controls (low-level and high supervisory algorithms) to be implemented in EV to achieve optimum performance as well as the realization of fast-charging stations. The rapid growth of EV has led to the integration of alternative resources to the utility grid and hence smart grid control plays an important role in managing the demand. The awareness of environmental issue and fuel crisis has brought up the sales of EV worldwide.},

  abstract = {Since the smart grid deals with a large mass of data and critical missions, it requires ubiquitous, reliable, and real-time communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which has the potential of connecting all objects over the globe through the Internet, excels in providing robust information transmission infrastructure in the smart grid. There are a multitude of possible protocols, standards, and configurations for communication in the smart grid. A commonly applied communication standard IEC 61850 recommends the use of Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) protocol for communication in Local Area Network (LAN) and eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) in Wide Area Network (WAN). However, a plethora of research on this topic compares the behavior of other IoT protocols and standard recommendations in the smart grid. On the other hand, the sky-rocketing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), especially in the form of micro grid, transformed the central control structure of the smart grid into a distributed style called Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This new approach defined new communication requirements and more particular IoT protocol characteristic requirements. However, a limited number of the existing studies have considered IoT protocol characteristic requirements of the smart grid and its new control structures. In this paper, we initially investigate the communication requirements of the smart grid and introduce all IoT protocols and their specifications. We analyze IoT protocol characteristics and performances in the smart grid through literature review based on the smart grid communication requirements. In this approach, we highlight weak points of these practices making them fail to acquire the holistic guidelines in utilizing proper IoT protocol that can meet the smart grid environment interaction requirements. Using the existing facilities, the public Internet, we follow the arrangement of cost-effective high penetration communication requirements for new structures of the smart grid, i.e., the MAS and multi-micro grid. In this case, we consider IoT protocol Quality of Services (QoS) requirements, especially in the case of security and reliability, to satisfy stakeholders, namely utilities and prosumers. Addressing effective elements in applying IoT in the smart grid\&rsquo;s future trends is another contribution to this paper.},

Input-to-State Stability properties are proven for suitably defined electrical and magneto-mechanical observation-error subsystems. Time scale separation is, then, exploited to invoke Singular Perturbation arguments and guarantee boundedness of the observation errors trajectories. Finally, the Small Gain Theorem is adopted to prove semiglobal uniform asymptotic stability of the presented scheme. Some additional interesting properties are discussed, beside the ``main stream'' of the proposed analysis. Simulations indicate the observer can be profitably exploited for induction machines speed sensorless control applications.},

First, a nonlinear block control (NBC) transformation is applied to handle nonlinearities of motor faulty model. Afterwards, a fault tolerant speed controller is developed based on sliding mode control (SMC) technique with linear sliding surface. However, the utilized NBC transformation needs multiple derivatives calculations which make it computationally burden. In addition, this NBC transformation has unmatched fault rejection problem which SMC controller is not able to remove the fault. To avoid the mentioned drawbacks, a novel and simple NBC transformation is proposed for IM. Also, a new nonlinear sliding surface is presented in order to enhance the SMC controller performance. Comparative simulations demonstrated performance of the proposed controllers for matched and unmatched faults and load torque uncertainties.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, lithium-ion batteries have become the battery technology of choice for portable devices, electric vehicles and grid storage. While increasing numbers of car manufacturers are introducing electrified models into their offering, range anxiety and the length of time required to recharge the batteries are still a common concern. The high currents needed to accelerate the charging process have been known to reduce energy efficiency and cause accelerated capacity and power fade. Fast charging is a multiscale problem, therefore insights from atomic to system level are required to understand and improve fast charging performance. The present paper reviews the literature on the physical phenomena that limit battery charging speeds, the degradation mechanisms that commonly result from charging at high currents, and the approaches that have been proposed to address these issues. Special attention is paid to low temperature charging. Alternative fast charging protocols are presented and critically assessed. Safety implications are explored, including the potential influence of fast charging on thermal runaway characteristics. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and recommendations are made for the direction of future research. The need to develop reliable onboard methods to detect lithium plating and mechanical degradation is highlighted. Robust model-based charging optimisation strategies are identified as key to enabling fast charging in all conditions. Thermal management strategies to both cool batteries during charging and preheat them in cold weather are acknowledged as critical, with a particular focus on techniques capable of achieving high speeds and good temperature homogeneities.},

A comparison algorithm between the reference and measured rotor speed is used to detect the speed sensor faults. A counter is added to eliminate the influence of the encoder noise in the diagnosis method. In this approach, estimated quantities are not used in the proposed speed sensor fault diagnosis strategy, which increases the independence between the diagnosis stages in the fault-tolerant control (FTC) method. Moreover, in order to discriminate between the speed sensor faults and the current sensor faults, a new approach combining the current space vector and a delay function is proposed to reliably determine the current sensor failures. The MATLAB-Simulink software was used to verify the idea of the proposed method. Practical experiments with an induction motor drive controlled by DSP TMS320F28335 were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of this method in practice.

  abstract = {In this study, experimental tests for an observer-based controller scheme are given to drive a sensorless Induction Motor (IM) even for the low frequencies case. Combining the advantages of a field oriented controller with the backstepping control method, a new robust controller is designed to track low frequencies trajectories. The static errors are eliminated using an integral backstepping technique, improving the robustness properties of the controller in spite of the uncertainties and the perturbations. An adaptive interconnected observer is designed for estimating fluxes, speed, load torque and the stator resistance in order to implement the controller. The knowledge of the stator parameter is crucial for sensorless control in particular to track low-speed trajectories when the observability property is lost. Practical stability based on Lyapunov theory has been proved to guarantee the strongly uniformly practical stability of the closed-loop system using the proposed observer-controller scheme. The tests are completed thanks to the reference trajectories of a specific sensorless IM benchmark where the robustness properties are validated under parameter variations and in presence of disturbances even for the low frequencies case.},

  abstract = {Field-oriented speed control of induction motors (IMs) without mechanical sensors (speed sensor and load torque sensor) are considered. The methodology is divided into two parts. First, interconnected high-gain observers are designed to estimate the mechanical and magnetic variables from the only measurement of stator current. Secondly, the speed and flux estimation are used by a controller to achieve the speed/flux tracking. The flux regulation problem is simple and the traditional approach is followed by using proportional integral (PI) controller. For the speed-regulation problem, it is stated that flux regulation quickly happens by using a high- gain PI controller to regulate the g-axis current to its reference. Stability analysis based on Lyapunov theory is proved to guarantee the 'observer + controller' stability. To test and validate the controller-observer by considering the sensorless control problem of IM at low frequency, a significant benchmark is implemented. The trajectories of this benchmark are designed to validate the controller and observer under three operating conditions: low speed, high speed and very low speed. Furthermore, robustness tests with respect to parameter variations are given in order to show the performance of the proposed observer-controller scheme.},

A system suck as this should also be fault tolerant and include the capability for redundancy. These goals can be met by paralleling together smaller inverters if a control scheme can be designed to allow them to operate independently yet still share the load. We have developed a control technique for operating two or more single phase inverter modules in parallel with no auxiliary interconnections. This technique uses frequency, fundamental voltage, and harmonic voltage droop to allow independent inverters to share the load in proportion to their capacities. Simulation results are provided to prove the concept.},

This latter is dedicated to the French energy billing system within the peak/base hour's contract. All the algorithms are tested over a set of 1000 data composed of real elements with four different daily energy price profiles. The results show a great efficiency of the V2G-OLC algorithm compared to the traditional optimal charging strategies.

The dead-beat control has good transient response, but it suffers from parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. In order to provide robustness, a discrete-time integral term is added to the dead-beat current prediction. The stability analysis is carried out considering the prediction error dynamics, nonlinear uncertain model of PMSM, and the integral action as the states of the overall system. The designed robust predictive controller is tested through numerical simulations and experiments. The proposed controller is easy to implement and suitable for high-performance PMSM applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a combinational-logic-based approach for identifying faults that could occur in the drivetrain of an electric vehicle (EV). A real-time simulation model of an EV is used to study the behavior of available sensor signals and control commands, with specific measured quantities, during vehicle operation. Those quantities could be, but are not limited to, mean values of the phase currents, DC bus current, traction motor speed (if available), in addition to control command quantities. Focus is given to these quantities which are abundant in vehicle inverters and controllers for no added sensing costs. Those quantities carry information of offsets and disturbances that could occur under faulty operating conditions compared to nominal operation, and are thus observed and studied under these conditions. Using such information, a method is developed using simple combinational logic and thresholds to diagnose a fault occurring at any time during a vehicle drive cycle. By combining features of measured quantities that behave similarly irrespective of when the fault occurs during a driving cycle, the proposed method is fault-time-insensitive. The proposed method is presented and validated by real-time simulations to capture over 20 different faults injected at different drive cycle times and in different drivetrain components-electric machine, inverter, transmission, and sensors. Results show that the proposed method is able to robustly and successfully diagnose different faults irrespective of when would they occur.},

  abstract = {As distributed renewable energy sources (RES) continue to expand, the necessity arises for more robust coordination approaches and conversion techniques to tackle the challenges introduced by uncertainties in renewable generation. Increasing concerns about energy efficiency and power grid security, such as the significant number of conversion stages for energy production from renewable resources and the bidirectional power flow in the distribution system, have attracted attention to the topic. The presented comprehensive review in this paper discusses the merits and weaknesses of different integration strategies as supported by the literature review. In particular, the focus is placed on the challenges of interconnection and opportunities for direct current (DC) systems. The ultimate objective of this paper is to explore the most important power grid-wide effects due to the expected renewable energy expansion and to gain insights on the availability characteristics of DC microgrids to facilitate their integration with the power grid. The idea behind this is to establish inferences that energy conversion based DC microgrids can be a possible solution to mitigate the negative effect of renewable energy expansion. This is accomplished by systematically reviewing studies on power grid integration as well as providing technical analysis of the resulting outcomes in relation to the general impact of renewable energy production, and then, conducting a comparative study on renewable energy conversion based DC and alternating current (AC) systems. The types of bus topologies and control of DC distribution systems are also intensively reviewed and discussed. Moreover, the protection design considerations, control classifications and standards of DC microgrids are highlighted to explore the future research trends to be undertaken. The review concluded that the impact of interconnection on power grid can be eliminated through the use of intelligent control with advance communication technologies and the implementation of DC microgrids powered by sustainable resources in the distribution system.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EV), including Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV), Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), are becoming more commonplace in the transportation sector in recent times. As the present trend suggests, this mode of transport is likely to replace internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the near future. Each of the main EV components has a number of technologies that are currently in use or can become prominent in the future. EVs can cause significant impacts on the environment, power system, and other related sectors. The present power system could face huge instabilities with enough EV penetration, but with proper management and coordination, EVs can be turned into a major contributor to the successful implementation of the smart grid concept. There are possibilities of immense environmental benefits as well, as the EVs can extensively reduce the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the transportation sector. However, there are some major obstacles for EVs to overcome before totally replacing ICE vehicles. This paper is focused on reviewing all the useful data available on EV configurations, battery energy sources, electrical machines, charging techniques, optimization techniques, impacts, trends, and possible directions of future developments. Its objective is to provide an overall picture of the current EV technology and ways of future development to assist in future researches in this sector.},

The strengths of sliding mode controllers result from the ease and flexibility of the methodology for their design and implementation. They provide inherent order reduction, direct incorporation of robustness against system uncertainties and disturbances, and an implicit stability proof. They also allow for the design of high performance control systems at low costs. SMC is particularly useful for electro-mechanical systems because of its discontinuous structure. In fact, since the hardware of many electro-mechanical systems (such as electric motors) prescribes discontinuous inputs, SMC has become the natural choice for direct implementation. The book is intended primarily for engineers and establishes an interdisciplinary bridge between control science, electrical and mechanical engineering.},

Using consensus control, a good performance can be achieved in dc microgrid with reduced communication. However, the effects of communication topology on system stability is not analyzed in detail in literature. For a given power network, various reduced communication topologies are possible. The stability of system depends on communication network topology and the power network parameters. This paper investigates stability of dc microgrid for different communication topologies. Equations for the system with the secondary controller using reduced communication is derived and state space model is analyzed to see the effect of communication topology on the stability of the system.

It is considered that the dc MG contains nonlinear constant power load (CPL) and is subjected to actuator faults. Current sensors are not installed and the voltages of the dc MG are measured in the presence of noise and sensor faults. To estimate the system states, a novel dual-Extended Kalman filter is proposed, which simultaneously estimates the states and faults. The fault- and noise-free estimations are then deployed in a nonlinear Takagi{\textendash}Sugeno fuzzy predictive controller to regulate the dc MG. The proposed method outperforms the exiting results, being robust against faults and noise. Also, the predictive scheme makes it robust against system uncertainties and forces the system states to converge the desired values, precisely. The accuracy and robustness of the developed method are evaluated and compared to advanced state-of-the-art techniques for a typical dc MG with a resistive load, CPL, and energy storage unit.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) for sensors of aircraft. In the most general case, fault detection of these sensors on modern aircraft is performed by a logic that selects one of, or combines, the three redundant measurements. Such a method is compliant with current airworthiness regulations. However, in the framework of the global aircraft optimization for future and upcoming aircraft, it could be required, e.g., to extend the availability of sensor measurements. Introducing a form of analytical redundancy of these measurements can increase the fault detection performance and result in a weight saving of the aircraft. This can be achieved by exploiting the knowledge of the kinematic relations between the measured variables. These relations are exactly known giving the advantage that no model-mismatches need to be accounted for. Furthermore these relations are valid over the whole flight envelope and general for any type of aircraft. Two example applications will be presented, showing the applicability of the method for the FDI of air data sensors and measurements of the inertial reference unit.},

This development will provide a reliable and low-cost control and data acquisition systems for the Renewable Energy Laboratory at Universitat Polit{\`e}cnica de Val{\`e}ncia (LabDER-UPV) in Spain, oriented to the research on microgrid stability and energy generation. The developed low-cost SCADA operates on a microgrid that incorporates a photovoltaic array, a wind turbine, a biomass gasification plant and a battery bank as an energy storage system. Sensors and power meters for electrical parameters, such as voltage, current, frequency, power factor, power generation, and energy consumption, were processed digitally and integrated into Arduino-based devices. A master device on a Raspberry-PI board was set up to send all this information to a local database (DB), and a MySQL Web-DB linked to a Web SCADA interface, programmed in HTML5. The communications protocols include TCP/IP, I2C, SPI, and Serial communication; Arduino-based slave devices communicate with the master Raspberry-PI using NRF24L01 wireless radio frequency transceivers. Finally, a comparison between a standard SCADA against the developed Web-based SCADA system is carried out. The results of the operative tests and the cost comparison of the own-designed developed Web-SCADA system prove its reliability and low-cost, on average an 86\% cheaper than a standard brandmark solution, for controlling, monitoring and data logging information, as well as for local and remote operation system when applied to the HRES microgrid testbed.},

Hence, the inverter is able to inject independently active and reactive power to the grid. The controller provides a proper dynamics decoupled from the grid-impedance magnitude and phase.

  abstract = {The authors develop and present a new model of a hybrid vehicle and control strategy. The hybrid vehicle is a general class of vehicles in which the prime power and the driveline are decoupled. The configuration considered in this paper consists of a diesel engine driving a permanent magnet generator that supplies rectified power to a DC link, which in turn supplies power through an inverter to an induction motor for traction. The control system proposed is hierarchical with controllers at the component, subsystem, and system level. Direct torque control (DTC) algorithm is applied to control the induction motor. The subsystem controllers consist of feedback control loops encompassing sliding mode, bang-bang, and conventional control laws. At the system level, a logic controller balances source and loads on the system bus. All models and controllers are simulated using MATLAB and SIMULINK computer program. The performance and scalability of each subsystem controller is demonstrated in stand-alone computer simulations. The modelling and control strategy proposed in this paper provides a robust, scalable system model for simulating the effects of standard driving cycles on the power system of a given vehicle configuration over long time scales.},

  abstract = {Most of High-impedance faults (HIFs) occur due to broken conductors falling on high-resistivity desert soil in United Arab Emirates remain undetected due to incredibly low fault currents and endanger lives. A reliable detection method is needed. A live line test conducted on a 11kV distribution line by switching to a remotely laid conductor did not result enough detectable fault currents. This motivated conducting a literature survey and researching for the reasons why the modern numerical protection relays could not detect such low current faults. Hence, a sensitivity analysis of a single-phase-to-ground system is carried out. Mathematical modelling for the sensitivity analysis is performed using differential calculus. Applying definition of sensitivity to a set of power system equations to analyze to provide guidance for detection of high impedance faults is entirely a new approach. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of single phase to ground fault system by exhibiting profiles of fault currents, line, neutral, and MV bus voltages for a range of fault impedance. The sensitivity analysis results conclude that low-fault current signals should be collected from the neutral line of the distribution system instead of focusing on the line voltage, current, power and other parameters.},

The novelty lies in the observer design that employs the combination of high-gain observer and sliding mode observer. The proposed observer does not impose the small-Lipschitz-constant condition on the system nonlinearity. By imposing a structural assumption on the nonlinear fault distribution matrix, the observability of the faults/unknown inputs w.r.t. the outputs is safeguarded and sliding modes are utilized for their reconstruction. The reconstruction of the faults from the sliding mode only relies on the output estimation error and thus can be implemented online together with the state estimation. Finally, an application to flexible joint robotic arm is used to illustrate the proposed method.},

A simple non-linear activation function called as Elliott function is used to reduce the execution time. To reduce the cost, and effectively utilise resource, the concept of layer multiplexing is adopted. The lowest bit precision needed for good performance of the estimator is identified and implemented. The proposed NN based flux estimator using simple excitation function and minimum bit precision is implemented using layer multiplexing technique. The designed estimator is tested on Spartan FPGA kit (3sd1800afg676-4) and the results obtained are presented.},

The speed sensorless control is formulated by developing a new model reference adaptive system (MRAS) using the outer product of {\textrightarrow}vs* and {\textrightarrow}is as the functional candidate. Contrary to the method available that depends on stator resistance, the proposed approach is immune to the variation of stator resistance. This is possible by using reference quantities (i.e., voltage and currents) in reference model and actual quantities (i.e., currents) in adjustable model. The current estimation on the other side extracts the information of the phase currents in two-phase stationary reference frame by using the corresponding synchronous reference frame variables and the vector rotator. The current estimation also does not depend on stator resistance and hence the complete system can perform very well at low speed. The proposed speed and current estimation techniques are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and experimentally validated through a dSPACE-1104-based laboratory prototype.},

  abstract = {High performance control requires high loop gain and large control bandwidth. However, the spurious resonances at the higher frequencies can limit the performance of such type of systems. This drawback can be overcome by using sensor fusion technique. In sensor fusion, two or more sensors are combined in synergy such that good performance is achieved at lower frequencies while ensuring robustness of the system at higher frequencies. This paper presents a new technique, termed as ``virtual sensor fusion'', in which only one of the sensors is physically installed on the system while the other sensor is simulated virtually. The virtual sensor is selected based on desired high frequency response. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated numerically for a case of active seismic isolation. A robustness analysis of virtual sensor fusion is also carried out in order to study its stability in the presence of spurious resonances. Finally, the technique is experimentally verified on active isolation of pendulum system from ground motion. The results obtained demonstrate good isolation performance at lower frequencies and robustness to plant uncertainties (spurious resonances) at higher frequencies. This technique can be effectively used for high precision control of sensitive instruments.},

  abstract = {Rotor and stator resistances along with load torque are typically uncertain quantities in induction machines. The machine heating makes the winding resistances vary during operation whereas the load torque strictly depends on the application. All those variables need to be on-line estimated to improve the drive performances and in particular to minimize the power loss at steady state. A new adaptive observer is designed in this brief. It is able to exponentially estimate the motor fluxes and to identify the aforementioned critical parameters from stator currents/voltages and rotor speed measurements. In contrast to other solutions proposed in the literature, rotor and stator resistances are not estimated on the same time scale. New insights on the behavior of an intuitively inspired observer are thus given through a detailed stability proof, which does not rely on linearization arguments around constant operating conditions. Persistency of excitation conditions, which only depend on exogenous signals to the estimation error system, are analyzed in detail and a clear physical interpretation is presented. Key features of the proposed solution are the overall simplicity of the estimation scheme, the low dimension of the regressor matrix (being exactly related to the number of unmeasured or uncertain quantities) and the exponential convergence to zero of the estimation errors. Simulations confirm the correctness of all the mathematical derivations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in implementing an advanced version of the indirect field oriented control scheme: the uncertain rotor flux modulus reference that minimizes the power loss at steady state can be actually estimated and imposed.},

Certain relevant experimental evidences concerning the use of such single adaptive observer in the aforementioned context, however, are yet to be theoretically motivated. Such evidences go beyond the already presented analyses and refer to the convergence of the resulting observer estimates under generating operations. In this paper, we present an algebraic equations-based analysis that extends any previous one, by providing a definite answer to the above question. It simultaneously clarifies any structural intrinsic limitation that is related to previously proposed approaches. The key point relies on deriving the explicit expressions for two admissible motor model solutions, which are characterized by the same output (rotor speed and stator currents) and input (stator voltages) profiles and whose existence is definitely linked to the adaptive observer behaviour in speed sensor fault detection scenarios.},

The back electromotive force (EMF) is calculated from the stator current and the stator voltage signals. The magnetizing currents are obtained from the back EMF. A theorem which gives the rotor speed estimate in the continuous-time domain is formulated using the magnetizing current estimation. The stability analysis is achieved based on the Lyapunov approach. Moreover, the discrete-time approach of the method is discussed, and a theorem for the discrete-time implementation is proposed. The limits that ensure the system stability for the switching gains and for the observer gain are discussed. This paper shows that the limits for the gains of the discrete-time algorithm are different from the limits for the gains of the continuous-time algorithm. Simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis. In addition, experimental results based on a fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) platform (DSP TMS320F2812) demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {The sensorless control of induction machines, particularly for operation at low speed, has received significant attention in recent years. To realize a field-oriented control of AC machines that is able to work at zero speed, the most commonly used methods are either sensor-based models or transient-signal-excitation methods. The major disadvantage of present signal-injection methods is that they are intrusive to pulsewidth modulation (PWM). An additional switching sequence has to be embedded in the control that will cause a torque and current ripple. In order to overcome these problems, a new flux-estimation algorithm that uses the phase current derivative to extract the flux-position information is presented. In contrast to previously introduced methods, this new approach operates without additional transient excitation of the machine and requires only fundamental-wave excitation using standard PWM or slightly modified PWM. Furthermore, only the current response in the two active states of PWM is used. This makes it possible to use sensorless control for the whole speed range including overmodulation and removes the distortion and parasitic influence of the zero switching states during the estimation of the flux. Experimental results are presented to validate the applicability of the presented approach.},

Secure and reliable seamless transition represents one of the most challenging engineering tasks during the microgrid design phase. Existing literature has several shortcomings - proposed microgrids are either ungrounded or not effectively grounded; DER transformer configurations are not properly implemented; communications within the microgrid do not reflect realistic time delays and there is very little discussion of the impact of relay protection settings on the proposed microgrid protection. This paper presents a new microgrid protection and control scheme that enables seamless islanding and grid synchronization using the point of common coupling (PCC) breaker relays, battery energy storage system (BESS) inverter controller and remote input/output mirror bits based communications approach (85RIO). All schemes have been implemented in the field within the electric utility's microgrid installed on the 12.47kV distribution feeder. The results presented in this paper are based on approximately 9,000 islanding and grid synchronization transitions.},

Particular focus is put on the transition region, i.e., the speed region where the estimator switches between signal-injection and back-EMF-based methods. It is shown that the estimator may become unstable for certain setups of machine parameters and operating conditions if the transition region is determined incorrectly.

Instead of traditional trade-off design between sensitivity to faults and robustness to disturbances, this study aims at maximising FD rate given a predefined false alarm rate. The proposed approach in this study follows two steps: first, in the norm-based framework, the parity relation-based offline FD system achieves maximal FD rate by minimising the set of undetectable faults; then the optimal offline FD system is equivalently transformed into a recursive FD algorithm for online use. Relationship between the obtained solution in this study and the existing ones is analysed. The performance improvement of the proposed approach is illustrated by comparing against existing methods through Monte Carlo simulations.},

The tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC), which is usually unknown, needs to be accurately estimated to calculate the in-wheel motor torque and evaluate the fault in real time. An observer is applied to each of the in-wheel motors to generate a TRFC estimate from the respective wheel. The individual estimates of the TRFC are merged using a voting scheme, which can reject the erroneous estimate from the faulty motor. Then, the resulting accurate TRFC estimate is adopted to calculate the residual for each of the in-wheel motors and to detect the possible actuator fault. Experimental results from a prototype FWIA electric ground vehicle are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.},

Based on direct torque control (DTC) with space vector modulation, a series of diagnostic and tolerant control methods have been proposed for five types of faults, namely, speed-sensor fault, dc-link voltage-sensor fault, current-sensor fault, open-phase fault, and open-switch fault. First, diagnosis and tolerant schemes are proposed for speed-sensor fault by estimating the rotor angle speed with the rotating speed of stator flux. Second, diagnosis and tolerant schemes are proposed for dc-link voltage-sensor fault by combining the current model based stator flux observer with the voltage model based stator flux observer. Third, a three-step method is designed to diagnose three types of faults related to current signals, namely, current-sensor fault, open-phase fault, and open-switch fault simultaneously. A vector space decomposition based current estimation method is proposed to achieve fault-tolerant control for the current-sensor fault, and the voltage compensation based fault-tolerant control is presented for both open-phase and open-switch faults. The experiments have been taken on a laboratory prototype to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant schemes.},

Both the equivalent and instantaneous current change rates can be obtained by the observer-based calculation method.

At present, quantitative assessment of electrical safety considering the operation conditions of large-scale EV charging stations (EVCSs) has still remained a challenge. Driven by the hierarchy of hazard control mechanisms, this article proposes a holistic approach to evaluate the electrical safety of the large-scale EVCSs when coupled to renewable power generation. Our approach mainly focuses on several topics on the operational safety of EVCS primarily concerning: 1) the facility degradation which could potentially result in a compromised EVSE reliability performance and EVCS protection failure; 2) the cyberattack challenges when the smart charging and the communication between EVCSs and electric utilities are enabled; and 3) the potential mismatch between the renewable output and EVCS demand, which could trigger the system stability challenges during normal operation and inability to supply the critical EV loads during outages. The proposed framework will provide informative guidelines to the EVCS operators for continuous monitoring and effective management of the day-to-day EVCS operation.},

This paper proposes a new noise-assisted method, called EMD manifold (EMDM), for enhanced fault diagnosis of rotating machines. The major contribution is that the new method nonlinearly and adaptively fuses the fault-related modes containing different noise via a manifold learning algorithm, by which true fault-related transients are preserved, while fault-unrelated components including mode-mixing-induced components and the residual noise derived from both the added and self-contained noise are greatly suppressed. First, the sensitive mode is located among the modes obtained by the EMD method according to a newly proposed criterion. Then, a high-dimensional matrix is constructed of the sensitive modes obtained through a small number of EMD trials on the signals plus noise of different amplitudes. Finally, the manifold learning algorithm is performed on the high-dimensional matrix to extract intrinsic manifold of the fault-related transients. The high-dimensional matrix is repeatedly constructed with random noise added to adjust local data distribution of the matrix for adaptive EMDM feature learning. Experimental studies on gearbox and bearing faults are conducted to validate the proposed method and its enhanced performance over traditional noise-assisted EMD methods.},

Initially, all faulty modes are classified into three fault clusters according to the number and location of faulty IGBTs. Then, the matching mechanism of the multi-mode FTC strategy corresponding to the three clusters is described, and the appropriate FTC algorithm is selected for each cluster. A new FTC method is proposed for Cluster I including double IGBTs faults in different H-bridges and different groups, which improves the utilization efficiency of healthy IGBTs in the faulty H-bridges, and minimizes the voltage level drop after the fault. Finally, the multi-mode FTC strategy has been applied to a 7-level inverter through simulation. Results have shown significant improvement of the output voltage waveform symmetry and harmonic distortion for the three clusters. The new FTC method has been applied to an experimental 5-level inverter. The obtained results confirm the validity of the methodology. With the proposed strategy, the output voltage waveform has recovered its symmetry, eliminated the undesirable DC component and achieved lower harmonic distortions.},

Two groups of special three-phase conduction current pulse signals are injected into the three phases of the motor, and the mathematical formulation for the initial angle position estimation is illustrated. The initial rotor position is expressed as a function of the line voltage, the phase current derivative, and the average value of d{\textendash}q frame stator inductance. Particularly, the independent parameters of the initial rotor angle position are eliminated in the mathematical model.

This article puts forward a new single current sensor (SCS) method for a permanent magnet synchronous motor three-phase current reconstruction, with a novel hybrid pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique introduced. This method is implemented by changing the position of SCS from dc bus to a current branch, and a modified space vector PWM technique is employed to realize the phase current reconstruction. Compared with traditional SCS control methods, the proposed method can relieve the measurement dead-zones at sector boundary region without introducing extra compensation algorithms. Besides, this method can be realized not only with a single hall-effect current sensor but also a single shunt resistor, which further expands the applications and increases the system reliability as well. This method is also available in other motor control with a two-level three-phase PWM voltage source inverter topology. The accuracy and feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the simulation and experimental results.},

With a small signal injected to the flux command, the method can accurately complete the online tuning of Tr over a wide range of speed estimation, including the rated speed and the very low speed of 1 Hz or even lower speeds under both no-load and loaded operations. Sensitivity of stator resistance error is studied, and the impact of stator resistance error on this method is severely reduced by the closed-loop structure of combined voltage and current (UI) mode flux observer. The identification process only needs the ac component amplitude without considering ac component phase drifts; thus, the division by zero at the zero-crossing point is avoided, which greatly increases the accuracy. Furthermore, any differential integral operations or even a filter is not needed; hence, the computation is rather simple and time saving. Moreover, unlike other signal injection methods, there are no special requirements on the injected signal frequency. The accuracy and validity of the method has been verified by Matrix Laboratory simulation model. Further experimental results on a 2.2-kW 50-Hz 4-pole induction motor also show effectiveness of this proposed method.},

First, a real-time optimal distribution strategy is devised to allocate the torque demands to each actuation motor of the vehicle with the aim to make them work in high-efficiency regions as often as possible. The primary goal is to minimize the energy consumption per hundred kilometers while maximizing the driving range per charge. Then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to globally search for the optimal sizing solution, which is later verified by the Genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed PSO-based optimization method, combined with the real-time torque distribution strategy, can effectively downsize the main powertrain components and lead to better energy consumption.},

Both technologies have been introduced to speed-sensorless- controlled motor drives, and increasing applications of PLLs and FLLs for speed estimation are foreseen. To enable a proper and good design, a thorough review of the PLL- and FLL-based speed estimation schemes is then provided in this article. It is revealed through the review that many PLL- and FLL-based estimation schemes fail to accurately track a frequency ramp (i.e., obvious estimation errors appear), which may lead to a compromised estimation accuracy when these schemes that are applied in induction motor drives operating during acceleration and deceleration processes. To address this, the proven speed estimation schemes together with new attempts are also presented in this article. Moreover, various challenges to the PLL- and FLL-based speed estimation schemes, including harmonics, dc offsets, and parameter variations, are considered when evaluating these schemes. Solutions to tackle these disturbances are accordingly presented. In addition, two representative estimation schemes are exemplified through experimental tests. Finally, further challenges in using the PLL- and FLL-based schemes for speed estimation are discussed.},

A simplified method of designing the feedback gain matrix of the sliding-mode observer is introduced for easy application. The PLL coefficients are analyzed by considering the expected position estimation error and the operating condition. Compared with the conventional arc-tangent calculation method, the proposed quadrature PLL estimation method can be immune to the influence of the noise and distortion. To achieve the robust high-efficiency operation of the sensorless IPMSM, an enhanced online maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control strategy without motor parameters dependent is adopted for the vector control drive. The optimal MTPA operation is achieved by searching the optimal current angle online to make the current amplitude be the minimum. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with a 2.2-kW IPMSM sensorless drive.},

Furthermore, a cross-coupling feedback mechanism is proposed to solve the instability problem when the machine runs in the low-speed regenerating or plugging-in mode. The cross-coupling feedback coefficient is adjusted by the estimated speed or the speed command (conditional) for further simplification and is easy to be implemented.

A cost function with adjustable weight coefficients is specially designed by taking the motor power capability and the tire workload into consideration.

  abstract = {A fault classification method is proposed which has been applied to an electric vehicle. Potential faults in the different subsystems that can affect the vehicle directional stability were collected in a failure mode and effect analysis. Similar driveline faults were grouped together if they resembled each other with respect to their influence on the vehicle dynamic behaviour. The faults were physically modelled in a simulation environment before they were induced in a detailed vehicle model under normal driving conditions. A special focus was placed on faults in the driveline of electric vehicles employing in-wheel motors of the permanent magnet type. Several failures caused by mechanical and other faults were analysed as well. The fault classification method consists of a controllability ranking developed according to the functional safety standard ISO 26262. The controllability of a fault was determined with three parameters covering the influence of the longitudinal, lateral and yaw motion of the vehicle. The simulation results were analysed and the faults were classified according to their controllability using the proposed method. It was shown that the controllability decreased specifically with increasing lateral acceleration and increasing speed. The results for the electric driveline faults show that this trend cannot be generalised for all the faults, as the controllability deteriorated for some faults during manoeuvres with low lateral acceleration and low speed. The proposed method is generic and can be applied to various other types of road vehicles and faults.},

  abstract = {With the rise of battery electric vehicles to mass production, many technical improvements have been realized to drastically increase the electric range, efficiency, and sustainability. However, insights into those valuable state-of-the-art solutions are usually not shared with researchers due to the strict non-disclosure policies of electric vehicle manufacturers. Many studies, therefore, rely on assumptions, best-guess estimates, or insider knowledge. This article presents an in-depth multi-scale analysis of the electric powertrain characteristics of a Volkswagen ID.3 Pro Performance. The focus is set on the range, power, and lifetime perceivable by the user. Thorough experimental tests are performed from the battery cell to vehicle level, following the energy conversion from source to sink. Energy densities are determined at all levels and the absolute electric range is quantified under varying operating conditions. Power capability and efficiency is evaluated at cell level by quantifying the battery cell and pack performance with current rate tests in charge/discharge scenarios and impedance determination, as well as by determining powertrain energy conversion efficiency with in-vehicle measurements. Moreover, accelerated aging tests of the lithium-ion battery cells are performed with close to real-world conditions and projected to vehicle level, demonstrating that the lithium-ion battery pack achieves mileages outperforming the warranty information of the manufacturer under real-world operation. Overall, the results provide valuable insights into the current state of the art and can serve as a reference for automotive engineering in academia. Over 10~GB of lithium-ion battery cell, pack, and overall powertrain measurement data from the lab and real-world environment is available as open source alongside the article.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an average active power sharing control strategy based on the distributed concept for the parallel operation of voltage source inverters is proposed to be applied to the modular uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. The presented method is named distributed adaptive virtual impedance control (DAVIC), which is coordinated with the droop control method. Low bandwidth CAN-based communication is used for the requirement of data sharing of the proposed method in the real modular UPS system. Unlike the conventional virtual impedance control techniques, the virtual impedance of a converter module is adjusted automatically by using global information when DAVIC is applied, further to tune the output impedance of the power modules. The adaptive virtual impedance is calculated by using the difference between the active power of a local module and the average active power of all the modules in a modular UPS. The DAVIC overcomes the drawback of the conventional virtual impedance control since an accurate value of the real output impedances of different converter modules is not required. Simulations using PLECS and experiments on a real commercial modular UPS are developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology. These results shown a superior power sharing performance is obtained when using the proposed method.},

As one promising power interface between energy storage components and power bus, dual-active-bridge (DAB) dc{\textendash}dc converters have gained wide applications due to the advantages of galvanic isolation, symmetric circuit structure, high power density, and easy control implementation. In this article, based on the triple-phase shift (TPS) control, a fast and effective fault diagnosis strategy is proposed for DAB converters to improve both the power conversion efficiency and reliability. First, the operation principle of DAB converters with TPS control is presented. Then, a fast and effective open-circuit fault (OCF) analysis under different operation modes of TPS control is presented. Based on the resonant phenomenon during the fault conditions, an OCF diagnosis strategy that uses midpoint voltage as diagnosis criteria is proposed for DAB converters under the advanced TPS control to identify the faulty devices quickly and avoid the system collapse. After the failure switches are located, fault-tolerant operation is adopted to maintain the power transmission ability of DAB converters and ensure safe operation. The experimental results are provided to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the OCF performance analysis, fault diagnosis, and tolerant method.},

Considering the price and volume of the system, a motor drive system applied with shunt and sensorless has been recently studied. However, there is some area that cannot measure three phase current especially in high-speed motor operation where the MI (Modulation index) is increased. It deteriorates the control stability because of the phase current distortion in motor control. In this paper, the boundary where phase currents cannot be obtained is defined and the method for reconstructing the phases current are proposed by predicting phase current in the area which phase current measurement is impossible. Also, the EMF observer and synchronous voltage recalculation method are applied for sensorless control considering both linear area and over-modulated area.},

Current sensor failure (outage), speed/position sensor loss (disconnection), and damaged DC-link voltage sensor are considered faults. The occurrence of these faults in PMSM drive systems degrades system performance and affects the safety, maintenance, and service continuity of the electrical system drives. The proposed method is based on the monitoring signals of ``abc'' currents, DC-link voltage, and rotor speed/position using a measurement chain. The listed signals are analyzed and evaluated with the generated residuals and threshold values obtained from a Sliding Mode Current-Speed-DC-link Voltage Observer (SMCSVO) to acquire an on-line fault decision. The novelty of the method is the faults diagnosis algorithm that combines the use of SMCSVO and adaptive thresholds; thus, the number of false alarms is reduced, and the reliability and robustness of the fault detection system are guaranteed. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm's performance is experimentally analyzed and tested in real time using a dSPACE DS 1104 digital signal processor board.},

In this article, the HESS is considered as an essential tool in hydrogen-integrated transportation and power systems to alleviate EV charging demand forecast error in a fast-charging station (FCS) and to solve voltage deviation problem due to the huge uptake of fast chargers on the utility grid. First, the wavelet transform (WT) method and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are combined to precisely predict the nonstationary traffic flow (TF). Then, a queueing theory-based model is developed to convert the predicted TF to the expected EV charging demand in FCS by considering charging service limitations and driver behaviors. Third, the charging demand prediction error is used to schedule the components in a HESS by considering their inherent properties and operational limits. As a result, the HESS configuration can be determined by analyzing the tradeoff between the investment cost and the monetary penalty due to charging demand forecast error and voltage deviation. The proposed solution is validated through a case study with mathematical justifications and simulation results.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of incipient fault diagnosis for a class of Lipschitz nonlinear systems with sensor biases and explores further results of total measurable fault information residual (ToMFIR). Firstly, state and output transformations are introduced to transform the original system into two subsystems. The first subsystem is subject to system disturbances and free from sensor faults, while the second subsystem contains sensor faults but without any system disturbances. Sensor faults in the second subsystem are then formed as actuator faults by using a pseudo-actuator based approach. Since the effects of system disturbances on the residual are completely decoupled, multiple incipient sensor faults can be detected by constructing ToMFIR, and the fault detectability condition is then derived for discriminating the detectable incipient sensor faults. Further, a sliding-mode observers (SMOs) based fault isolation scheme is designed to guarantee accurate isolation of multiple sensor faults. Finally, simulation results conducted on a CRH2 high-speed railway traction device are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the optimal sizing and the experimental verification of a vehicle-used hybrid energy storage system (HESS). To determine the optimized combination that maximizes the traveling distance at an FTP driving pattern, an exhaustive search method was employed. Under constraints of cost, vehicle acceleration, and HESS gross weight, the optimal sizing can be derived. Next, for the purpose of investigating the transient behavior of HESS, equivalent circuits of the lithium battery set and ultracapacitors are proposed. Parameters of all components in circuits can be identified via Nyquist empirical formula and experimental data. An HESS testing platform was established for performance verification. It consists of an HESS, a battery control unit (BMS), power circuits, and an DC Electronic Load. With a supervisory computer, control variables can be adjusted online, while testing data can be retrieved. The results show that using HESS, system performance and battery cycle life will be improved.},

To improve the reliability of power electronics, better understanding of failure modes and failure mechanisms of reliability{\textendash}critical components in power electronic circuits are needed. Many efforts have been devoted to the reduction of IGBT failures, while the study on the failures of freewheeling diodes is less impressive. It is of importance to investigate the catastrophic failures of freewheeling diodes as they could induce the malfunction of other components and eventually the whole power electronic circuits.

The concept of allelic points is proposed and corresponding functions are defined to describe the symmetry of the VSI physical topology under healthy and faulty conditions. The residuals between any two phase functions are applied as criterion for allelic points. Under healthy condition, three legs are symmetrical and the residuals are all closed to zero, when open-circuit fault occurs, the residuals will be larger than a predefined threshold, so it is used to detect fault occurrence. When fault occurs, the near-zero current samples per fundamental period will get large, its proportions in a period will be different when different fault classes occur. The fault can be located combined the functions and residuals based on the analysis of VSI topology. The simulations and experiments are carried out and the results show the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed method.},

The use of the nonlinear sliding-mode technique provides very good performance for both low- and high-speed motor operation and robustness in motor losses and load variations. The proposed observer uses neither a PI controller nor complicated observer gains, thus establishing an easy setup for any type of motor. Also, the convergence of the proposed observer is examined using the Lyapunov theory. Experimental results using a TMS320F240 digital signal processor are presented for low-speed operation (5 Hz), full speed operation (50 Hz), and forward to reverse operation.

The DFIG system is decomposed into stator, rotor, grid current models, and the sensor fault observer (SFO) is presented to provide accurate estimations of sensor fault components in the presence of model uncertainties. Based on the independent current dynamics of DFIG system, three SFOs are designed in parallel to respectively estimate the stator, rotor, and grid current senor fault signals. During the occurrence of faults, the fault estimations derived from current observers are adopted to compensate the faulty signals, thereby achieving the system reconfiguration of DFIG without requiring any fault diagnosis schemes. Simulation studies are undertaken on a grid-connected WECS under the conditions of stepped and random wind speeds, and single and multiple current sensor faults. Simulation and experimental results reveal that the FTC-controlled DFIG system is resilient from the sensor faults and maintains continuous stable operation.},

Centralized control with high-/low-pass filter (LPF) for system net power decomposition and ESs' power dispatch is usually implemented in hybrid ES system (HESS). In this paper, hierarchical control of HESS, composed of both centralized and distributed control, is proposed to enhance system reliability. The conventional HESS centralized control is refined with implementations of online iteration, secondary voltage regulation, and autonomous state-of-charge (SoC) recovery. ESs' power references are iteratively generated to maximize the utilization of ES ramp rates and power capacities. Secondary voltage regulation and autonomous SoC recovery are applied to minimize bus voltage deviation and limit slack terminal SoC variation, respectively. In case of communication failure, a novel algorithm for HESS distributed control is proposed to retain system operation. Bus voltage is regarded as the global indicator for system power balance, and droop relationships are imposed for ES control. System net power decomposition and ESs' power dispatch are realized with localized LPFs. SoC recovery in distributed control is implemented by tuning the threshold voltage of a slack terminal. A laboratory-scale dc microgrid is developed to verify the proposed hierarchical control of HESS.},

First, the fundamental ZSV injection is applied to adjust the modulation margin of three phases where the amplitude values of modulation waves in each phase can be the same. Then, if the amplitudes with fundamental ZSV injection are still in over-modulation status, the new irregular ZSV injection is added to further enlarge the operation region. In addition, the limitation of the irregular ZSV injection is analyzed. Simulation and experimental results of MMC under different grid voltage swell conditions verify the effectiveness of the proposed operation approach.},

  abstract = {Flux estimation is of great importance for high-performance motor drives. In order to improve flux estimation accuracy and reduce system complexity, a new flux estimation method based on the second-order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop (SOGI-FLL) was presented recently. Compared with the conventional low-pass filter-based method, the SOGI-FLL does not need compensation and can effectively attenuate the high-order harmonics in the back electromotive force (back EMF). However, the dynamic performance of this method is not satisfactory, because the back EMF frequency estimated by FLL suffers from inaccuracy and double-frequency oscillation when the back EMF changes. This paper presents a detailed theoretical analysis on the dynamic errors of the SOGI-FLL-based flux estimation method. To overcome the drawback, an improved method based on dual SOGI-FLL (DSOGI-FLL) is proposed. The properties and performance of the DSOGI-FLL-based flux estimation method are analyzed in comparison with the SOGI-FLL, demonstrating its improved dynamic response. Simulations and experimental results on an 11-kW three-phase induction motor verify the excellent performance of the proposed DSOGI-FLL-based flux estimation method.},

With either rotating or pulsating signal injection, the second harmonic position errors arise due to the parameter asymmetry. Furthermore, it is found that for the two carriers, the second harmonic errors are different for resistance asymmetry but the same for inductance asymmetry. In order to suppress the position errors, the carrier signal selection guidelines are discussed for resistance asymmetry, while for inductance asymmetry, novel online compensation strategies with dual-frequency injection are also proposed. Finally, the theoretical analyses and proposed compensation methods are validated by experiments on an interior PM (IPM) machine with added phase resistance/inductance to simulate asymmetric conditions.},

As an important form of distributed generation, renewable generation may change rapidly and frequently, which poses great challenges on the management and control of microgrids. Energy storage systems are often utilized to address the intermittency of renewable generations. This paper proposes an optimal control-based energy management of multiple energy storage system to dynamically minimize the adjustment cost while keeping track of the energy storage system state of charge and maintaining the supply-demand balance in a microgrid. The proposed algorithm has taken the influences of time-of-use price, time-varying distributed generations and loads, transmission loss, energy storage system charging/discharging, and storage efficiency into account. The optimality of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed through rigorous analysis. Simulations on a 5-bus microgrid under various conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

As is well known, the advantages of sensorless motor drives include lower cost, increased reliability, reduced hardware complexity, better noise immunity, and less maintenance requirements. With the development of modern industrial automation, more advanced sensorless control strategies are needed to meet the requirements of applications. For sensorless motor drives at low-and zero-speed operation, inverter nonlinearities and motor parameter variation have significant impact on the stability of control system. Meanwhile, high observer's bandwidth is required in high-speed region. This paper introduces the state of art of recent progress in sensorless AC motor drives.

The adaptive-tunning technology solve the detuning problem by rematching the resonance parameters so that the system can always work in the resonant state, ensuring the efficient and high-power transmission of the system. Because of the unique features of wireless power transfer system including isolated transmitter and receiver side, delay of communication, and wide-range parameter variation, there is additional challenges of adaptive-tunning technology compared to its application in traditional converters. This paper firstly introduces the resonance characteristic of wireless power transfer system, then summaries the existing adaptive tunning technologies, including frequency tracking and dynamic compensation.

Next, a faulty phase detection scheme using an adaptive threshold is proposed to achieve sensitive and robust detection results.

Subsequently, a faulty switch location method and the current sensor fault type identification method are proposed, using some of the same identification variables. Finally, combining the faulty phase detection variables with the identification methods ensures the feasibility of the detection and identification of 12 open-circuit faults and 9 current sensor faults.

In comparison to existing sliding mode control (SMC) faulttolerant designs, the proposed schemes not only can retain the advantages of traditional SMC, including fast response, easy implementation and robustness to disturbances/uncertainties, but also make the system states reach the control objective point in a finite amount of time. Moreover, they also resolve the potential singularity phenomena in traditional terminal and faster terminal sliding-mode control designs; meanwhile, the proposed NFTSMC fault-tolerant scheme also possesses the benefit of faster state convergence speed of NFTSMC. Finally, the proposed analytical results are also applied to the attitude control of a spacecraft. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed schemes.},

An active vector pulse insertion method achieves this objective by applying additional active voltage vectors in the brief intervals, and guaranteeing the invariant duty cycle in three-phase leg configuration during each fundamental frequency cycle.

A decision-directed (DD) mode carrier recovery loop runs jointly with adaptive equalizer. It eliminates intersymbol interference (ISI) and phase error better than separate structure. The non-linear decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is also adopted. Compared to linear equalizers, it has better performance on compensation for channel distortion. In this scheme, the signal synchronization preamble is equalized and phase compensated firstly in order to open the signal eye pattern, then adaptive equalization and carrier synchronization are carried out for data symbols. Simulation shows this all-digital demodulation scheme is feasible and efficient for HF QAM signals. It provides theoretical foundation for the DSP implementation},

However, the car-following performance is inevitably affected by a series of disturbances, particularly, sudden velocity changes of leading vehicle. To improve accuracy and response rate of car-following control in the presence of such disturbances, an improved super-twisting compensator (ISTC) is proposed and a composite controller is designed by combining ISTC with a finite- time controller. A second-order nominal system is constructed by using a virtual measurement signal along with its integration to facilitate the design of ISTC. By introducing the feedback of high-order estimation error, the accuracy and response rate of ISTC are increased significantly as compared with the conventional one under same gains. Such improvement further enhances the disturbance rejection ability of the composite controller.

Considering that, a position sensorless control method that uses only one current sensor is proposed. Different from a traditional position sensorless control scheme that utilizes additional current sensors to obtain information of multiple phase currents, only a single current sensor (SCS) arranged on one of the current branches is included among the whole control circuit. Three-phase currents are reconstructed by sequentially sampling the SCS under specific voltage vectors, and directly employed for motor position estimation. A nonlinear position observer established according to the gradient descent is adopted. Focusing on the special current-acquisition pattern in this article, a step-size optimization method based on golden section search is proposed to minimize position estimation error. The experimental results reveal that the method in this article is comparable to the traditional full-current-sensor method in terms of position estimation, which confirms the fault-tolerant capability as one certain sensor of the control structure malfunctions.},

A scalable and pervasive communication infrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we present the background and motivation of communication infrastructures in smart grid systems. We also summarize major requirements that smart grid communications must meet. From the experience of several industrial trials on smart grid with communication infrastructures, we expect that the traditional carbon fuel based power plants can cooperate with emerging distributed renewable energy such as wind, solar, etc, to reduce the carbon fuel consumption and consequent green house gas such as carbon dioxide emission. The consumers can minimize their expense on energy by adjusting their intelligent home appliance operations to avoid the peak hours and utilize the renewable energy instead. We further explore the challenges for a communication infrastructure as the part of a complex smart grid system. Since a smart grid system might have over millions of consumers and devices, the demand of its reliability and security is extremely critical. Through a communication infrastructure, a smart grid can improve power reliability and quality to eliminate electricity blackout. Security is a challenging issue since the on-going smart grid systems facing increasing vulnerabilities as more and more automation, remote monitoring/controlling and supervision entities are interconnected.},

The sideband harmonics resulting from the pulse width modulation tend to be different from one inverter to another, which may trigger sideband harmonic resonances among the paralleled inverters. To address the sideband harmonic instability, the nonlinearity of the digital pulse width modulator is analyzed first in this paper based on the harmonic balance principle. It is revealed that the dynamic sideband components corresponding to a given small-signal perturbation can be far below the Nyquist frequency, and they may not be effectively attenuated by antialiasing filters. A multifrequency impedance model is then developed for the inverter, which characterizes the dynamic coupling between the perturbed frequency component and the sideband frequency component. The impact of asynchronous carriers on the sideband harmonic instability of paralleled inverters can, thus, be analyzed, and the frequency and phase sequence of the resulting oscillation components are predicted. Experimental results of two paralleled inverters confirm the effectiveness of the developed model and the stability analysis.},

After open-circuit fault occurs, harmonic current vectors will follow different trajectories according to different faulty phases. However, this event can only be evident in case of single phase fault occurrence. Thus, existing technique can only identify limited types of open-switch fault. This article proposes a simple and efficient open-switch fault detection strategy to extract fault features. Proposed strategy is able to locate any combinations of open-switch faults, which cannot be realized in the previous literature. The faulty phases are detected first to reduce computational burden and for avoidance of false alarms. Then the faulty switches are determined on the basis of the direction of current vectors in the harmonic plane. Taking account of open-switch faults in different phases, normal current vectors are reconstructed with newly defined auxiliary current variables, which can be utilized to detect the failure of multiple switches and result in enhanced robustness. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multiple open-switch fault detection method in a seven-phase machine at 5.5 kW power level.},

This paper presents a six-phase current reconstruction technique for dual traction inverters in case of the failure of phase current sensors. With an extra current sensor installed in the DC link, missing phase currents can be derived from the DC-link current by applying the proposed phase shift strategies to the driver signals. All the current sensor failure scenarios and their corresponding phase shift schemes for current reconstruction are considered. With the proposed current reconstruction scheme, current sensor fault-tolerant operation of dual traction inverters is achieved. Even in the worst case when all the phase currents are missing, the maximum allowable modulation index demonstrates slight degradation.

During the phase current reconstruction, one of the inverters is proposed to operate using active vectors, whereas the other inverter operates using nonactive vectors. An advanced phase-shift scheme for all pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) signals based on the sequence of duty cycles is implemented. PWM signals are considered in three types: large, medium, and small duty cycles. Then, the minimum phase-shift scheme is applied to each type of PWM signal to ensure the minimum duration of the active vector for stable current reconstruction. With this proposed phase-shift scheme, the maximum allowable modulation index and dc-link voltage utilization are improved. In addition, the relationship between the minimum required time for stable phase current reconstruction and the maximum allowable modulation index is derived theoretically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by both simulation and experimental results. With this scheme, cost and volume of dual inverters in HEVs are reduced, considering the lower number of current sensors.},

In addition, the present approach offers the potential of mitigating not only transistor switch faults but also drive related faults such as rectifier diode short-circuit fault or dc link capacitor fault. In this new approach, some of the drawbacks associated with the known fault mitigation techniques such as the need for accessibility to a motor neutral, overrating the motor to withstand higher fundamental rms current magnitudes above its rated rms level, the need for larger size dc link capacitors, or higher dc bus voltage, are overcome here using the present approach.

Because of their high selectivity, their performance is very dependent on the accuracy of the resonant frequency. An exhaustive study about different discrete-time implementations is contributed in this paper. Some methods, such as the popular ones based on two integrators, cause that the resonant peaks differ from expected. Such inaccuracies result in significant loss of performance, especially for tracking high-frequency signals, since infinite gain at the expected frequency is not achieved, and therefore, zero steady-state error is not assured. Other discretization techniques are demonstrated to be more reliable. The effect on zeros is also analyzed, establishing the influence of each method on the stability. Finally, the study is extended to the discretization of the schemes with delay compensation, which is also proved to be of great importance in relation with their performance. A single-phase active power filter laboratory prototype has been implemented and tested. Experimental results provide a real-time comparison among discretization strategies, which validate the theoretical analysis. The optimum discrete-time implementation alternatives are assessed and summarized.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of open-switch faults of a voltage source inverter system is investigated. A new fault diagnosis method based on an observer and an adaptive threshold is proposed. This method only needs to utilize the signals existing in a system without the need for extra hardware circuits. First, an observer is designed on a model of a three-phase voltage source inverter system to estimate currents. Then, an adaptive threshold is designed on fault residuals, dynamics of the currents and variations of the system operating state. Moreover, the dead time and switching delay time are also included in the threshold to consider practical applications. Furthermore, to achieve on-line real-time diagnosis and to improve the reliability of the proposed method, the averages of the current residuals in a current fundamental period are defined as diagnostic variables. Finally, the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by simulation and experiment results.},

Analyzing the state space model of VSI when fault occurs, a state observer of the system is built to estimate phase currents. Once the open-switch fault occurs, the current residual vector between the estimated currents on observer and the measured currents, and fault diagnosis is realized by exploiting the featured amplitude and phase of the current residual vector. In order to realize on-line diagnosis with high reliability and speed, the average value of current residuals in a fundamental period is obtained and Clark transformation is performed so as to acquire vector angle. In addition, the sum of absolute values of measured currents is normalized to serve as the sign of fault occurrence. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed method.},

The adoption of electric vehicle into market has introduced significant impacts on various fields, especially the power grid. Various policies have been implemented to foster the electric vehicle deployment and the increasing trend of electric vehicle adoption in the recent years has been satisfying. The continual development of electric vehicle power train, battery and charger technologies have further improved the electric vehicle technologies for wider uptake. Despite the environmental and economical benefits, electric vehicles charging introduce negative impacts on the existing network operation. Appropriate charging management strategies can be implemented to cater for this issue.

The PWM inverter obtaining three phase current by shunt resistor is comparatively cheaper than the method that measures three phase current by Current Sensor. And it reduces the size of AC motor drive system. However, the method sensing the phase current using shunt resistor cannot perform the vector control in high motor speed since there is the area that cannot measure three phase current. In this paper, the boundary where phase currents cannot be obtained is defined and the method reconstructing the phase current is proposed by predicting phase current through load modeling in the area which phase current measurement is impossible.

  abstract = {Fault-tolerant control is attracting more interests due to its capability of increasing the reliability of voltage source inverters (VSI). Fault detection, localization, and tolerant control schemes of current sensor are presented for high-fault-tolerance induction motor drives. Generally, three-phase current sensors are used in high-power inverters; nevertheless, failure of current sensors degrades the performance and reliability and even leads to the breakdown of the vector control system due to the fact that flux angle cannot be estimated correctly. The proposed scheme integrates three independent observers, taking a-phase current, b-phase current, and c-phase current as inputs, respectively. The observers are capable of online monitoring the state of current sensors under normal operation. Furthermore, after one or even two current sensors getting faulty, the observers can detect and localize the faults and switch the system to tolerant vector control mode even with only one healthy phase current sensor available. Hence, it is very attractive in some safety crucial applications. Stability and convergence of the observer are analytically derived and verified. A dSpace-based 1.1-kW induction motor variable-speed system is set up for the experiment, and experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm.},

The steering system is modeled as a hybrid system with continuous dynamics and discrete modes using the hybrid bond graph tool. Multiple faults of different types, i.e., abrupt fault, incipient fault, and intermittent fault, are considered using the concept of Augmented Global Analytical Redundancy Relations (AGARRs). A fault discriminator is constructed to distinguish the type of faults once they are detected. After that, a fault identification scheme is proposed to estimate the magnitude of abrupt faults, the characteristic of intermittent faults, and the degradation behavior of incipient faults. The fault identification is realized by using a new adaptive hybrid differential evolution (AHDE) algorithm with less control parameters. Based on the identified degradation behavior of incipient faults, prognosis is carried out to predict the remaining useful life of faulty components. The proposed algorithm is verified experimentally on the steering system of a CyCab electric vehicle.},

  abstract = {A 4-independent wheel driving (4-IWD) electric vehicle has distinctive advantages with both enhanced dynamic and energy efficiency performances since this configuration provides more flexibilities from both the design and control aspects. However, it is difficult to achieve the optimal performances of a 4-IWD electric vehicle with conventional design and control approaches. This paper is dedicated to investigating the vehicular optimal design and control approaches, with a 4-IWD electric race car aiming at minimizing the lap time on a given circuit as a case study. A 14-DOF vehicle model that can fully evaluate the influences of the unsprung mass is developed based on Lagrangian dynamics. The 14-DOF vehicle model implemented with the reprogrammed Magic Formula tire model and a time-efficient suspension model supports metric operations and parallel computing, which can dramatically improve the computational efficiency. The optimal design and control problems with design parameters of the motor, transmission, mass center, anti-roll bar and the suspension of the race car are successively formulated. The formulated problems are subsequently solved by directly transcribing the original problems into large-scale nonlinear optimization problems based on trapezoidal approach. The influences of the mounting positions of the propulsion system, the mass and inertia of the unsprung masses, the anti-roll bars, and suspensions on the lap time are analyzed and compared quantitatively for the first time. Some interesting findings that are different from the `already known facts' are presented.},

  abstract = {A speed control of sensorless induction motor (IM) drives at zero and very low frequencies is designed in this paper. A new adaptive sliding mode observer (SMO) to estimate the stator current, rotor flux, and rotor speed is proposed. To improve the robustness and accuracy of an adaptive SMO during very low frequency operation, the sliding mode flux observer uses independent gains of the correction terms. The gains of current and rotor flux SMOs are designed using Lyapunov stability theory to guarantee the stability and fast convergence of the estimated variables. A Lyapunov function candidate utilizing the error of rotor fluxes and speed estimation error is synthesized for speed estimation. Detailed simulations and experiments are given showing the operation of the sensorless speed control at very low frequency. The results prove the accuracy and robustness of the proposed adaptive SMO. Also, comparison results with the state-of-the-art methods prove that the proposed method shows excellent transient and steady-state speed estimation, particularly at very low and zero frequency operations.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a robust sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) method based on the unknown input observer (UIO) approach is presented. The basic principle of unknown input observers is to decouple disturbances from the state estimation error. A single full-order observer is designed to detect sensor faults in the presence of unknown inputs (disturbances). By doing so, we generate a residual, a weighted output of the state estimation error, decoupled from disturbances. The resulting robust (in the sense of disturbances) residual can be used for fault detection. Although this scheme has successful fault detection, using one observer is not successful in fault isolation. Therefore, a robust sensor fault isolation observer scheme is proposed. In order to evaluate its ability, the presented method is adopted to detect and isolate sensor faults of a highly nonlinear dynamic system. The faulty behavior of output sensors in a jacketed continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), around operating point, is investigated. Simulation results show that model uncertainties and disturbances can be distinguished from a response to a sensor fault.},

  abstract = {Currently, in high-performance applications, the vector control (VC) scheme of induction motor (IM) is widely employed in industry. The VC scheme has significant features of decoupling torque and flux; also, its hardware implementation is easier. Conventionally, PID control schemes are frequently used for variable speed operation. However, the performance of the VC scheme is limited over a wide range of speed operation because of de-tuning caused by parameter uncertainties. To address the aforementioned challenging problem, adaptive and robust control strategies are mostly implemented. This paper presents various novel, adaptive, and robust control strategies, namely (a) fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based on Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt algorithm (LMA), (b) FLC based on steepest descent algorithm (SDA), (c) FLC based on Newton algorithm (NA), and (d) FLC based on Gauss{\textendash}Newton algorithm (GNA) for the indirect vector control (IVC) three-phase IM. The focal motive is to accomplish fast dynamic response with fault-tolerant capability, load disturbance rejection qualities, insensitivity to the parameter uncertainties, robustness to speed variation, and to acquire maximum efficiency as well as torque. The \$\$d-q\$\$modeling of the IVC IM in the synchronous reference frame and space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) employed in inverter are designed in MATLAB/Simulink. Our work also presents critical, analytical, and comparative assessment of the proposed controllers with traditional tuned PI control strategy for the electrical faults perturbation, load disturbances, speed variations, and parameter uncertainties. Furthermore, the simulation results of the above-mentioned designed control strategies validated robust, smooth, and faster response with permissible overshoot, undershoot, settling time, and rise time for the IVC IM drive system, compared to prior works.},

Based on potential game, this paper presents a fully distributed operational optimization for MEMS with high penetration of renewable energy and demand response. After analyzing the microgrid and potential game, the establishment and proof of an exact potential game model is presented in detail. Then the best-strategy-response iterative algorithm is proposed to find the game Nash equilibrium in a distributed way. Finally, the proposed approach is simulated in an islanded microgrid to verify its efficiency and feasibility. The significances of this paper are as follows. First, the scheme and algorithm are fully distributed. All heterogeneous individuals are treated as independent decision-making entities without a central coordinator/processor. Second, the optimization process is open and dynamic. The convergence is achieved with no limits to type or number of players, even if the process of execution is corrupted with delay or losses in communication information. Third, the consistency between individual rationality and overall importance is guaranteed, and individual best-strategy-response behaviors necessarily improve overall optimality.},

It comprises a baseline controller, a set of reconfigurable controllers, a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) mechanism, and a decision mechanism. The baseline controller, which is actually a passive fault-tolerant controller, is applied to accommodate actuator faults and stabilize the faulty vehicle when the actuator fault occurs. After the fault is detected and estimated by the FDD mechanism, a proper reconfigurable controller is switched ON to achieve optimal postfault performance. Taking advantage of the robust gain-scheduling algorithm, the loss-of-effectiveness and additive faults of the IWMs can be accommodated by the baseline controller, and the estimation error of the FDD mechanism can be tolerated by the reconfigurable controllers. The results of simulations in CarSim and vehicle experimental tests show the effectiveness of this AFTC system in dealing with certain IWM faults.},

In this paper, to address the multi-motor coordinate operation against the actuator faults in the 4WID system, combining the adaptive sliding mode (ASM) control and the fault tolerant (FT) control allocation, an adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant coordination (ASM-FTC) control is proposed. Firstly, a new vehicle dynamic model with driving motor fault is set up. In the control layer, an adaptive variable exponential reaching law is used in the ASM to alleviate the chattering and improve the reaching speed, precision and robustness. Then, the FTC allocation based on the quadratic programming is designed to properly coordinate the four in-wheel motors at the present of the motor fault. To verify the proposed control method, a 4WID electric vehicle platform is set up. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ASM-FTC control.},

On the other hand, health management and fault tolerant control of manned aerial vehicles have a long history since the initial research on self-repairing flight control systems in US Air Force and NASA begun in mid-1980s. However, due to safety concern of manned aerial vehicles to the pilot, experimental tests and further practical research and development have been limited. Benefited from the recent and significant advance and development of UAVs, development and application of autonomous, fault-tolerant, as well as cooperative control techniques have been emerged and developed quickly in recent years, since UAVs provide a cheap and operative experimental testbed for development, implementation, testing and validation of the newly developed autonomous, fault-tolerant, as well as cooperative guidance, navigation and control techniques. In this talk, a brief review on the development of fault tolerant control techniques in the manned aircraft systems will be presented firstly, then the challenges and opportunities on autonomy and fault-tolerant control of unmanned systems will be given secondly, and finally the latest developments and current research work in this active research and development area with applications to autonomous fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs will be presented.},

The UPS system consists of a cluster of paralleled inverters with LC filters directly connected to an ac critical bus and an ac/dc forming a dc bus. The proposed control scheme comprises two layers: 1) a local layer that contains a ``reactive power-to-phase droop'' in order to synchronize the phase angle of each inverter and a virtual resistance loop that guarantees equal power sharing among inverters; and 2) a central controller that guarantees synchronization with an external real/fictitious utility, and critical bus voltage amplitude restoration. Improved transient and steady-state frequency, active, reactive, and harmonic power sharing, and global phase-locked loop resynchronization capability are achieved. Detailed system topology and control architecture are presented in this paper. Furthermore, a mathematical model was derived in order to analyze critical parameters effects on system stability. The proposed control approach has been validated by means of experimental results obtained for several case-study scenarios.},

  abstract = {The present study proposes a new scheme for detection and isolation of incipient sensor faults for a class of uncertain non-linear systems by combining sliding mode observers (SMOs) with a Luenberger observer. Initially, a state and output transformation is introduced to transform the original system into two subsystems such that the first subsystem (subsystem-1) has system uncertainties but is free from sensor faults and the second subsystem (subsystem-2) has sensor faults but without any uncertainties. The sensor faults in subsystem-2 are then transformed to actuator faults using integral observer-based approach. The states of subsystem-1 are estimated using an SMO to eliminate the effects of uncertainties. However, since subsystem-2 does not have any uncertainties, the incipient faults present in this subsystem are detected by designing a Luenberger observer. These faults are then isolated by applying a bank of SMOs to subsystem-2. The sufficient condition of stability of the proposed scheme has been derived and expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design parameters of the observers are determined by using LMI techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme in detecting and isolating sensor faults is illustrated considering an example of a single-link robotic arm with revolute elastic joint. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed scheme can successfully detect and isolate sensor faults even in the presence of system uncertainties.},

However, if there is a short circuit in any arbitrary phase or the inverter is used to feed a two-phase load, the output performance of conventional DPWM strategies will be deteriorated. Here, four improved DPWM (IDPWM) strategies for three-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) traction inverter fed two-phase load are proposed. Unlike three-phase load conditions, the phase angle and the amplitude of each basic voltage vector in the space vector diagram are modified under two-phase load conditions. Consequently, sectors are re-divided and duty cycles of basic vectors during synthesis are recalculated. Clamping intervals of each phase for the four type discontinuous PWM (DPWM) strategies are rearranged according to the modified space vector diagram; then, the proposed DPWM strategies can be obtained. Compared with the conventional DPWM strategies, the output current waveform quality of the proposed strategy is significantly improved. Meanwhile, the amplitude of the neutral-point voltage ripple is also reduced.},

  abstract = {Smooth running and rapid response are the desired performance goals for the transient motions of servo mechanisms. Because of the uncertain and unobservable transient behaviour of servo mechanisms, it is difficult to evaluate their transient performance. Under the effects of electromechanical coupling, the stator current signals of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) potentially contain the performance information regarding servo mechanisms in use. In this paper, a novel method based on analysing the stator current of the PMSM is proposed for quantifying the transient performance. First, a vector control model is constructed to simulate the stator current behaviour in the transient processes of consecutive speed changes, consecutive load changes, and intermittent start-stops. It is discovered that the amplitude and frequency of the stator current are modulated by the transient load torque and motor speed, respectively. The stator currents under different performance conditions are also simulated and compared. Then, the stator current is processed using a local means decomposition (LMD) algorithm to extract the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency. The sample entropy of the instantaneous amplitude, which reflects the complexity of the load torque variation, is calculated asa performance indicator of smooth running. The peak-to-peak value of the instantaneous frequency, which defines the range of the motor speed variation, is set asa performance indicator of rapid response. The proposed method is applied to both simulated data in an intermittent start-stops process and experimental data measured for a batch of servo turrets for turning lathes. The results show that the performance evaluations agree with the actual performance.},

A reference adjustment technique (RAT) with the designed controller are used to guarantee the safe implementation of AFD.

In this paper, a fault-tolerant direct torque control for a five-phase fault-tolerant fractional-slot concentrated-winding interior-permanent-magnet (FTFSCW-IPM) motor under the open-circuit condition of a single phase is proposed, in which an analogous three-phase space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) control strategy is adopted. The DTC system for the five-phase PM motor based on healthy SVPWM has several advantages of improved currents and low torque and flux ripples. To achieve the fault-tolerant operation of the SVPWM-DTC system, an analogous three-phase SVPWM strategy is proposed. The proposed SVPWM fault-tolerant control scheme is achieved by the division of six sectors and the reconfiguration of six equal nonzero voltage vectors, which is quickly computed and easily realized. In addition, based on a 2-kW FTFSCW-IPM motor prototype, the good performances of the proposed fault-tolerant drive are validated by both simulations and experiments, in which the average torque and low torque ripple during fault can be maintained. Finally, the dynamic performances under healthy and fault-tolerant conditions are measured. The results show that the proposed analogous three-phase SVPWM control can offer good dynamic performance, which is comparable to the healthy SVPWM.},

First, a feedback linearization approach is employed to handle the nonlinearities in the system. Then, to study the interaction among actuators in an actuator failure scenario, the FTC problem can be viewed as a cooperative game so that its four players, namely the four in-wheel motors can cooperate to provide more stability of the vehicle. The distributed model predictive control theory is adopted as a general framework, the Pareto strategies among the players are derived using an interactive model based on a convex iterative method. Furthermore, the conditions that guarantee the practical stability of the closed-loop system are provided. The intrinsic differences between the cooperative game and noncooperative game are investigated via a numerical simulation. The effectiveness and real-time of the proposed control strategy are verified in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop test, and the results prove that the control strategy can effectively guarantee the stability of the vehicle in various actuator failure scenarios.},

  abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is emerging as a powerful control method for the high performance control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives due to its merits of simple principle, quick response, and flexibility to handle multiple variables and constraints. However, conventional MPC applies only one voltage vector during one control period to minimize the cost function, which produces relatively high steady-state ripples and high computational burden due to the enumeration-based predictions. Introducing duty cycle control into MPC can improve its steady-state performance, but the control complexity is further increased. This paper proposes a generalized multiple-vector-based MPC for PMSM drives, which unifies the prior MPC methods in one frame with much lower complexity and computational burden by eliminating the enumeration-based predictions and complex calculations in conventional MPC methods. This is achieved by reconstructing the three-phase duties obtained from the classical deadbeat control with modulator, which also reveals the inherent relationship between deadbeat control and the proposed MPC methods. The presented experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

At each stage, only three of the six power switches exert a vital influence on this operation and the others make a negligible influence. An open-circuit fault of power switches introduces the repetitive current distortions, whose period is identical to that of the three-phase currents. The current distortions appear at faulty stages and disappear at healthy stages. The stage is determined by recalculating the current vector rotating angle. The d - and q-axis current repetitive distortions are applied to the detection of faulty switches due to its simplicity and fair robustness, while the faulty stages are used for the identification of faulty switches.

However, a conventional signal demodulation method may face the problems of long convergence time and limited system stability, owing to the low-pass filter (LPF) used in signal demodulation process. Thus, a direct signal demodulation method is proposed, in which, the LPF is removed to improve system stability and dynamic property. A direct demodulation collection is generated to extract the position deviation signal from estimated q-axis HF current. Recursive discrete Fourier transform is employed to calculate the amplitude of estimated d-axis HF current, thus an amplitude normalized technique is implemented to reduce the effects of HF signal and PMSM. Meanwhile, the stability and dynamic property are compared between the conventional and proposed method, with the aid of D-partition technique and amplitude-frequency characteristics diagram. Furthermore, a novel magnetic polarity detection method is put forward based on the magnetic saturation, which has a high signal-to-noise ratio.

In order to reduce the cost, volume, and weight, this article proposes a novel fault-tolerant three-phase surfacemounted permanent magnet synchronous machine (SPMSM) drive without split capacitors, auxiliary legs, or TRIACs. The proposed drive is still built upon a three-phase two-level VSI, whereas its dc-source is directly connected to the neutral point of the motor. First, mathematical model and equivalent circuit are established to reveal the existence of an equivalent dc/dc boost converter in the drive system. Second, the brand-new d-0 axes current references are proposed in order to preserve the motor's performance when an OPF occurs. In this case, both id and i0 are nonconstant. Third, an overall control strategy including the healthy and fault-tolerant modes is presented. In the fault-tolerant mode, a deadbeat current controller is developed to track the nonconstant current references. Finally, experiments are carried out on an SPMSM test-bench to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This paper presents a new reduced-order AVM for dual-active-bridge dc-dc converters. The proposed model considers the conduction and transformer power losses as well as the input/output filters, which may be very useful for system-level studies. Based on the large-signal AVM, the small-signal model and the control-to-output transfer function are also derived. The proposed AVM is compared with the full-order generalized average model and the detailed model in predicting large-signal transients and small-signal analysis in the frequency domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed model yields a high accuracy, which represents an improvement over other existing models.},

Distributed economic dispatch for a microgrid with high renewable energy penetration and demand-side management operating in grid-connected mode is considered in this paper. To address the intrinsically stochastic availability of renewable energy sources (RES), a novel power scheduling approach is introduced. The approach involves the actual renewable energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid, so that the supply-demand balance is maintained. The optimal scheduling strategy minimizes the microgrid net cost, which includes DG and DS costs, utility of dispatchable loads, and worst-case transaction cost stemming from the uncertainty in RES. Leveraging the dual decomposition, the optimization problem formulated is solved in a distributed fashion by the local controllers of DG, DS, and dispatchable loads. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.},

By using the integral observer approach, sensor faults are treated as actuator faults. A state and output transformation is introduced to transform the original system into two subsystems. One subsystem is subject to system uncertainties but free from sensor faults. A sliding mode observer is designed for this system so that the effect of uncertainties can be eliminated. The second subsystem is only subject to sensor faults but system uncertainties. A Luenberger observer is designed for this system for the purpose of fault detection. The sensor faults can be further isolated by applying a bank of SMOs to the second subsystem. The sufficient condition of stability of the proposed SMOs has been derived and expressed as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The design parameters of the proposed SMOs are determined by using LMI techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed SMOs in detecting and isolating sensor faults has been illustrated considering a numeral example. The result has been found to be satisfactory even for incipient sensor faults which are hard to be detected due to the nature of small in size and growing slowly during the initial phase.},

This novel FBLSM observer could accurately estimate the speed and flux even without known load torque, where chattering on estimations due to switching functions in normal sliding-mode observers is almost completely eliminated. The proof of observability in a wide speed range (including very low speeds) is given. The indirect vector controller with feedforward compensation is responsible for tracking motor speed or torque commands, which manages to accelerate algorithm processing and to enhance transient performance. The experimental results based on a high-power driver-load motor configuration validate the accuracy of the observer and the dynamical performance of the controller under multitrapezoidal speed and vehicle driving cycle torque-speed commands, taking into consideration unexpected parameter disturbances .},

In the second scheme, the assumption of matching condition is relaxed and an adaptive observer has been designed to estimate the sensor fault instead of using an SMO. The effects of the system uncertainties on the estimation errors of states and faults are reduced by integrating a prescribed H{$\infty$} disturbance attenuation level into the proposed schemes.

  abstract = {Model-based rotor position/speed estimators are commonly used for sensorless control of interior permanent-magnet synchronous machines (IPMSMs) operating in the medium- and high-speed regions. A rotor position/speed estimation scheme usually contains three major parts: a state observer, a position estimator, and a speed estimator. This paper proposes a sliding-mode observer (SMO) as the state observer to estimate the position-related system states, which are the extended electromotive force components in this paper. Then two major contributions are made to achieve improved position and speed estimation. Firstly, the rotor speed is estimated independently using a model reference adaptive system (MRAS)-based method, which is decoupled from the position estimation. To reduce the noise contents in the estimated speed, an adaptive line enhancer is proposed to work with the SMO, leading to an improved reference model for the speed estimation. The proposed MRAS-based speed estimator has two operating modes, which are suitable for generator and motor applications, respectively. Secondly, the estimated rotor speed is used as a feedback input signal to mitigate the oscillating error in the estimated rotor position, leading to an integrated position and speed estimation system. The effectiveness of the proposed position and speed estimators is verified by simulation using the data logged from a real-world test vehicle. Experimental results on a test stand of an IPMSM drive system used in off-road, heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles are also provided to further validate the proposed rotor position/speed estimation schemes.},

  abstract = {The open-circuit fault in converters is one of the wind turbine faults, which degrades the power quality and can even cause potential secondary faults in other components. So, an effective fault diagnostic technique for wind turbine converters is needed. This study presents a new open-circuit fault diagnostic approach for back-to-back converters of doubly fed (DF) wind turbines. The proposed fault diagnostic method has fault detection and fault localisation. The fault detection is based on the absolute normalised Park's vector approach; this method can detect multiple open-circuit switch faults and guarantee immunity to false alarms when the DF induction generator operates around the synchronous speed. For fault localisation, this approach applies the normalised current average values, which can be used to identify single and double open-circuit switch faults. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the diagnostic method can not only diagnose multiple open-circuit faults, but that false alarms due to transients can be avoided.},

First, the original PMSM system is transformed into two subsystems; the first subsystem has unknown system load disturbances, which are unrelated to sensor faults, and the second subsystem has sensor faults, but is free from unknown load disturbances. Introducing a new state variable, the augmented subsystem that has sensor faults can be transformed into having actuator faults. Second, two sliding mode observers (SMOs) are designed: the unknown load disturbance is estimated by the first SMO in the subsystem, which has unknown load disturbance, and the sensor faults can be reconstructed using the second SMO in the augmented subsystem, which has sensor faults. The gains of the proposed SMOs and their stability analysis are developed via the solution of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was verified by simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reconstruct current sensor faults and estimate unknown load disturbance for the PMSM-driven system.},

  abstract = {Electrical motor stator current signals have been widely used to monitor the condition of induction machines and their downstream mechanical equipment. The key technique used for current signal analysis is based on Fourier transform (FT) to extract weak fault sideband components from signals predominated with supply frequency component and its higher order harmonics. However, the FT based method has limitations such as spectral leakage and aliasing, leading to significant errors in estimating the sideband components. Therefore, this paper presents the use of dynamic time warping (DTW) to process the motor current signals for detecting and quantifying common faults in a downstream two-stage reciprocating compressor. DTW is a time domain based method and its algorithm is simple and easy to be embedded into real-time devices. In this study DTW is used to suppress the supply frequency component and highlight the sideband components based on the introduction of a reference signal which has the same frequency component as that of the supply power. Moreover, a sliding window is designed to process the raw signal using DTW frame by frame for effective calculation. Based on the proposed method, the stator current signals measured from the compressor induced with different common faults and under different loads are analysed for fault diagnosis. Results show that DTW based on residual signal analysis through the introduction of a reference signal allows the supply components to be suppressed well so that the fault related sideband components are highlighted for obtaining accurate fault detection and diagnosis results. In particular, the root mean square (RMS) values of the residual signal can indicate the differences between the healthy case and different faults under varying discharge pressures. It provides an effective and easy approach to the analysis of motor current signals for better fault diagnosis of the downstream mechanical equipment of motor drives in the time domain in comparison with conventional FT based methods.},

In order to achieve smooth transitions from prefault to postfault, an embeddable fault-tolerant method based on predictive torque control (PTC) is proposed. A generalized voltage vectors, switching command, and cost function accounting for both healthy and faulty conditions are introduced to carry out a general control scheme. A novel fault-diagnosis method based on probability density analysis of the sampling currents is presented for open-circuit fault isolation under PTC scheme. Seamless likely and rapid transient processes from fault occurrence to postfault operation are achieved.

In the case of faults occurring in any two inverter legs, the six-leg back-to-back converter can be changed to a four-leg back-to-back converter by employing one motor phase connected to the rectifier leg and another phase connected to the dc-link capacitor mid-point for fault-tolerant operation. The four-leg back-to-back converter is very attractive for the merit of not requiring additional power switches for fault-tolerant. However, as the shared-leg connection between inverter and rectifier, the rectifier and the motor drive are deeply coupled. A novel scheme-based model-predictive control is presented to achieve independent control of the grid and motor currents. The voltage limitation for independent control of the rectifier and motor drive is analyzed, and the dc-link voltage utilization is improved by capacitor voltage suppression. With the proposed scheme, the output speed range of the converter is degraded, but other performances, such as output torque capability, unity power factor, and the dynamic response, are maintained after faults occur. Finally, the control concept is verified by a TMS320F28335 DSP-based prototype.},

This article presents a strategy of trajectory planning and tracking that aims to ensure the UGV's safety in an uncertain environment. Specifically, based on the initial environment information, a global optimal trajectory connecting the start and the destination is predefined by an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA). In the presence of unforeseen obstacles, a trial-based forward search (TFS) algorithm based on the Markov chain is proposed in the local trajectory planning module, while collision prediction is integrated as heuristic information. The vehicle's current state is updated accordingly for the sake of avoiding entire state spaces involved in the computation. Therefore, the storage efficiency and convergence rate in local path planning are sufficiently enhanced in comparison to dynamic programming. Moreover, command signals can be calculated with the proposed multiconstrained model predictive controller (MMPC), ensuring the vehicle to track the reference trajectory and smoothen the motion. Finally, the results in both simulations and experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles.},

Uncertainty determination in output is the most crucial step in sensitivity analysis. In the present paper, an analytic expression, which can exactly evaluate the uncertainty in output as a function of the output's derivatives and inputs' central moments, is firstly deduced for general multivariate models with given relationship between output and inputs in terms of Taylor series expansion. A \${$\gamma\$$}-order relative uncertainty for output, denoted by \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\^{$\gamma\_$}v\}\$, is introduced to quantify the contributions of input uncertainty of different orders. On this basis, it is shown that the widely used approximation considering the first order contribution from the variance of input variable can satisfactorily express the output uncertainty only when the input variance is very small or the input-output function is almost linear. Two applications of the analytic formula are performed to the power grid and economic systems where the sensitivity of both actual power output and Economic Order Quantity models are analyzed.

  abstract = {As a result of their reduced number of switches, three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverters are generally applied as cost-reduction topologies for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. However, the torque ripples of PMSM severely deteriorate the performance and reliability of the entire system. Hence, comprehensive considerations for torque ripple reduction, including high- and low-frequency torque ripples, are elaborated considering TPFS inverter-fed PMSM drives. The second-order torque harmonics produced by dc-capacitor voltage fluctuations are first demonstrated, and a very simple compensation method is presented by introducing a novel nonorthogonal coordinate transformation. Then, to evaluate the effects on the high-frequency torque ripples of space vector modulation (SVM) schemes, three SVM schemes for TPFS inverter-fed PMSM drives are assessed based on the torque ripple root-mean-square value. Consequently, the preferred SVM scheme is obtained for high-frequency torque ripple minimization. Moreover, the linear modulation range of the TPFS inverter-fed PMSM drive is derived considering capacitor voltage fluctuations, therein avoiding the low-frequency torque ripples caused by overmodulation. Meanwhile, an adaptive capacitor voltage offset suppression method is proposed to fully exploit the dc-link voltage. The experimental results demonstrate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed analysis and methods for torque ripple reduction.},

In view of this, the paper studies multi-sensor fault diagnosis and active fault-tolerant control strategies based on a composite sliding mode observer. With the mathematical model of PMSM built, a design method of the composite sliding mode observer is proposed. A single observer is used to observe and estimate various state variables in the system in real time, which simplifies the implementation of observer-related algorithms. In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of different types of sensors under different faults, a method for determining fault thresholds is proposed through global search for the maximum residual value. Based on this, a fault diagnosis and active fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed to realize fast switching and reconstruction of feedback signals of closed-loop control systems under different faults of multiple sensors, thus restoring the system performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and control strategy is verified by simulation experiments},

The integration of such distributed energy sources into utility grid paves the way for microgrids. The microgrid concept is introduced to have a self-sustained system consisting of distributed energy resources that can operate in an islanded mode during grid failures. In microgrid, an energy management system is essential for optimal use of these distributed energy resources in intelligent, secure, reliable, and coordinated ways. Therefore, this review paper presents a comparative and critical analysis on decision making strategies and their solution methods for microgrid energy management systems. To manage the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy resources and load demand, various uncertainty quantification methods are summarized. A comparative analysis on communication technologies is also discussed for cost-effective implementation of microgrid energy management systems.

The estimator model is built by learning from a dataset that associates phase currents and voltages to the rotor position. Learning signals are generated using a simulation model. This is primarily intended to save the resources invested in testbench trials. In this work, offline training steps and results are described and commented. The efficiency of the proposed position estimator is first verified by functional simulations. Second, real-time experiments are conducted on an actual scale testbench. The NN-based estimator covers a wide speed range and is implemented in the context of IPMSM-based EV traction drives.

Three different search methods have been developed to help reduce the computational burden by excluding many unsuitable participating voltage vectors and combinations in advance.

  abstract = {In order to improve the safety of steer-by-wire (SBW) system, a dual-motor SBW system is proposed to enhance the fault tolerance and reliability of the system. However, the dual-motor SBW vehicle often loses its stability due to the external interference, and the asynchronous response between the dual-motor will further deteriorate the stability of the vehicle. Aiming at the existing problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy, in which the upper layer controls the vehicle stability and the lower layer controls the synchronization of the dual-motor. Firstly, the models of dual-motor SBW system and the vehicle are established. Secondly, considering the interference of lateral wind, sensor noise and the limitation of control output, a yaw rate controller is designed in the upper layer based on the mixed H2/H{$\infty$} robust control theory to improve the stability and tracking performance of the vehicle. Thirdly, a sliding mode speed synchronization control strategy is proposed in the lower layer based on the cross-coupling control structure and the sliding mode control algorithm to enhance the synchronization performance between the dual-motor. Finally, the simulation is carried out by using Carsim/Simulink and the hardware-in-the-loop experiment is conducted based on the dual-motor SBW experimental station. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in this paper.},

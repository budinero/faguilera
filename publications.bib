  abstract = {The behavior of an electric vehicle and its electric traction drive under sensor faults is studied in this paper. With this aim, simulations over a vehicle model with rear traction, using an induction machine, were carried out. The drive model can switch between three different conventional control strategies. With this setup, the longitudinal dynamics behavior of the vehicle and the electrical variables of the drive against sensor faults and changes of the control strategy are analyzed. The obtained results are useful in the design of a sensor fault tolerant architecture.},

  abstract = {This work presents the design of a current-sensor fault detection and isolation system for induction-motor drives. A differential geometric approach is addressed to determine if faults can be detected and isolated in drives with two line current sensors by using a model based strategy. A set of subsystems is obtained based on the observability co-distribution, whose outputs are decoupled from the load torque (detectability) and only affected by one of the sensors (isolability). A bank of observers is designed for these subsystems in order to obtain residuals for the fault detection and isolation. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategy allows detecting single and multiple sensor faults, including disconnection, offset and gain faults. Experimental results validate the proposal.},

The system is composed by two standar control strategies and a bank of observers. The fault detection and isolation is performed by processing residuals generated by the bank of observers. When sensors are healthy, the motor is controlled by a vector control strategy using two current sensors. If a single current sensor fault occurs, the vector control is maintained by replacing the affected information with estimations generated by the bank of observers. If faults occur in both current sensors, a scalar control strategy is used in order to maintain the operation of the drive. The operation of the proposed system is validated by simulation results.},

  abstract = {Different induction machine (IM) models are evaluated, with the aim to determine its usefulness in efficiency studies for electric vehicles (EV) traction drives. In particular, two simple IM models proposed in the literature, which take into account the additional losses, are compared. With this aim, model parameters are adjusted from experimental tests performed on a 4 kW IM. Then, obtained results from both models at different operating points are compared. Even when the estimation errors are similar using both models, one of them is chosen because of its simplicity. Finally, a simple application of this model is proposed, which consists in use the model for obtaining a complete efficiency map of the IM, without need further essays. Such efficiency map can be used to evaluate the overall efficiency of the traction drive of an EV or in EV design.},

A bank of observers is designed based on representations of the induction motor model in different reference frames. The fault diagnosis is performed by processing a set of residuals obtained from the bank of observers. The diagnosis method is able to differentiate between single and multiple faults as well as identify the faulty sensor. In addition, virtual sensors are used for the control feedback reconfiguration to obtain a continuous operation of a vector control strategy after a sensor fault. Simulation results of an EV with the proposed FTA validate the effectiveness of the proposal and its robustness against parameter variations. Moreover, results shows a fast control reconfiguration and the ability to return to normal operation if the sensors recover from the faulty condition.},
